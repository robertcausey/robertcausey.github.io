%The year 2020 - 2021 saw the School of Food and Agriculture successfully adapt to the Covid-19 Pandemic. Our faculty successfully migrated their in person courses to Brightspace or other online formats. Meanwhile we were able to continue offer core in person teaching functions, such as hands-on activities at the Witter Center, esssential research at farms, and aspects of the Dietetic Internship. Two of our faculty (JUAN ROMERO and JEN PERRY) successfully applied for early tenure. This speaks to the nurturing environment we have provided young faculty. SUSAN SULLIVAN led an initiative with JEN PERRY and RACHEL SCHATTMAN to propose a Food System's major that will bridge all the three academic disciplines of the three of the former disciplines within the unit (FSN, PSE, AVS). We responded to the President's Define Tomorrow call with a proposal, led by ERIC GALLANDT, to address resiliency of Maine's food system in the context of Covid-19 and climate change. We won approval to hire a Nutritional Biochemist, the search for which is now its final stages with two well qualified candidates in the final selection. This successful recruiting effort speaks directly to the third goal of the President's Strategic Vision and Values framework, that ``The university will be a rewarding place to live, learn and work"  and to the R \& D goal for FY2020 - FY2024 ``To make Maine the best state in the nation in which to live, work, and learn by 2030". Despite the necessary upheaval, our faculty have made way for the new Advising Center which is to be based in space formerly occupied by our faculty in Deering Hall. Meanwhile, we were able to consolidate Sustainable Agriculture Faculty in the top floor of the Roger Clapp Greenhouses. Despite the pandemic our overal recruitment efforts appear to have achieved growth in the Environmental Horticulture and Animal and Veterinary Sciences majors. A reduction on FSN majors, reflecting a national trend, is partially offset by growth in our UMaine Gold online Masters Certificate programs in Food Science and Nutrition, led by MONA THERRIEN.  Our achievements and challenges are described in more detail below using the Strategic Visions and Values framework.

%Under the direction of Associate Director SUE SULLIVAN, SFA's undergraduate coordinators, EILEEN MOLLOY, CHARLENE GRAY and JIM WEBER proactively reviewed our undergraduate curricula in Food Science and Human Nutrition (FSN), Environmental Horticulture and Sustainable Agriculture (ENH/SAG), and Animal and Veterinary Sciences (AVS). Recent innovations include development of modules for the SAG curriculum, led by ERIC GALLANT, SUE ERICH, and RACHEL SCHATTMAN, and modification of the AVS curriculum to include new classes of SUE ISHAQ and an equine concentration within the undergraduate Animal Science curriculum \textbf{(SVV 1.1.1 \& 1.1.2)}. All our undergraduate curricula are focused on experiential learning, with most students performing research for their capstone experience, as employees, or as student investigators in the Center for Undergraduate Research or the Honors College. As part of the modularization of courses in SAG, we are increasing opportunities for microcredentials, along with the new UMaine GOLD program in Human Nutrition and Food Technology, and the Didactic Program in Dietetics (EILEEN MOLLOY coordinator) and the Dietetic Internship (MONA THERRIEN coordinator; \textbf{SVV 1.1.3, 1.1.4, \& 1.1.6)}. Other faculty in FSN (MARY ELLEN CAMIRE, DOROTHY KLIMIS ZACAS, and DENISE SKONBERG) contribute to the GOLD program, which has been coordinated by KATHRYN YERXA.  BRIAN PERKINS successfully compiled and filed an application for the Institute of Food Technologists approval of the Undergraduate program in Food Science.

Caribou Russetâ€™s cash farm value to ME
seed growers was ~\$3.9 M during 2020 and the estimated cash farm value when this seed crop is planted, grown and harvested in 2021 is ~\$33.1M. It is also being
evaluated and adopted in many other countries around the world. Hamlin Russet (tested as AF4124-7) was released by ME during 2020 for early fry processing and
russet fresh market. It has moderate scab resistance. Certified seed acreage rose to 83 acres (#78th in the US) during 2020.

RACHEL SCHATTMAN agricultural resilience in a changing climate while simultaneously protecting natural resources. In pursuit of this goal, I work with specialty crop producers and agricultural advisors to identify and address production challenges, specifically through the lens of climate change adaptation. Received almost \$240,000 for the following 3 projects:Climate change adaptation and mitigation research, outreach, and education for land managers in Maine and the Northeast; Enhancing adoption of regenerative agriculture practices in U.S. wheat farming system; The impact of the local food system and natural environment on rural food security and health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic

%Research conducted by faculty in SFA is driven by the land grant mission, and has direct impact on the lives of Maine citizens, the country and the world \textbf{(SVV 1.2.1)}. Consistent with the President's 2019 Research and Development Plan to ``Make Maine the best state in the nation in which to live, work, and learn by 2030" we address basic and applied science that changes the situation on the ground in Maine. At the molecular level, STOM OHNO continues to address the attachment of organic matter to inorganic matrices in soil, to increase our understanding of carbon trapping in the soil and its potential to mitigate climate change. SUE ERICH examines soil quality and the stabilization of soil organic matter, which helps to reduce fluxes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, potentially moderating rates of climate change. ERIC GALLANDT explores methods of weed control which are ecologically sound, employing a variety of mechanical methods that impose stresses at multiple points in a weedâ€™s life cycle and maintain soil quality. Our newest faculty member, RACHEL SCHATTMAN, studies the effects of water usage and agricultural irrigation irrigation through the lens of adaptation to climate change. \\~\\
%Our faculty in Animal and Veterinary Sciences also study the underlying mechanisms affecting human and animal health \textbf{(SVV 1.2.1)}. PAULINE KAMATH's research explores our understanding of host-pathogen co-evolution and infectious disease transmission dynamics, primarily in parasitic diseases affecting human, wildlife, and domestic animal health. JIM WEBER explores the seasonality of the parasite life-cycle in sheep, as a way to prevent economic loss for sheep producers, and ANNE LICHTENWALNER has evaluated several alternative antimicrobials against a common pathogen of sheep that causes caseous lymphadenitis (CL). In addition she collaborates with Maine Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (IFW) to evaluate moose and deer parasites and pathogens. SUE ISHAQ, who was hired in 2019, similarly explores the gut microbiome of wild and domestic animals, and the critical role of microbial communities in animal and human health and disease.\\~\\  
%Faculty in Human Nutrition continue to perform basic research at both the molecular, and behavioral level \textbf{(SVV 1.2.1)}. DOROTHY KLIMIS-ZACAS has shown that anthocyanin and phenolic acid extracts from wild blueberries reduce vascular damage that underlies coronary heart disease and wound healing (diabetes, burns, etc). This potentially has great economic impact for the Blueberry industry. Also, JADE MCNAMARA  developed a 120 item nutrition literacy survey for college students and an environmental assessment for low-income, rural communities. This work is necessary to address food security in Maine, an issue which has become critical during the Covid-19 pandemic.\\~\\
%Applied science by SFA faculty has created significant economic opportunity for Maine's agricultural and food sectors \textbf{(SVV 1.2.2)}. The development of the Caribou Russet and Pinto Gold potato varieties by GREG PORTER has created a commodity with an economic value of \$9.1 million for Maine growers. In addition, JAY HAO has successfully lessened the impacts of potato diseases, in part through evaluating different chemical compounds and varieties to obtain good candidate of chemical products or potato germ plasm for disease resistance breeding. In part, through his work, the pathogen distribution and evolution of blackleg and soft rot during the outbreak in Northeastern US was elucidated.\\~\\
%JENNIFER PERRY has developed methods to improve the microbiologic safety of a large variety of Maine food products, including fruit, vegetables, seafood and dairy products. DENISE SKONBERG has also explored the development of seaweed processing and the use of high pressure treatment to kill pathogens in seafood. MARY ELLEN CAMIRE has worked to develop healthful foods for older adults, and to promote foods produced in Maine. She has also explored the health benefits of dietary fiber and anthocyanins and explored consumer attitudes towards healthy foods, contributing to development of new food products. Her work shows that Consumers are unsure of how to incorporate seaweed into their diets, but have gained confidence in preparing fermented foods safely at home. \\~\\
%In AVS, JUAN ROMERO is working to patent lignosulfonates as hay preservatives. The current hay preservative market in the US is ~\$350 million for a ~\$16 billion annual hay market in the US alone \textbf{(SVV 1.2.2)}. TIM BOWDEN has assessed the oyster population in Damariscotta River Estuary, showing gene flow between commercial and natural bed populations over time. He has also studied the prevalence of the oyster parasite `` MSX" in Damariscotta River Estuary. His work shows that MSX prevalence has been greatly reduced, indicating that the changes in management practice in the Damariscotta Estuary may have aided in the removal of this important oyster pathogen from the system. \\~\\
%All of the above research faculty have been involved with undergraduate and graduate education, contributing to workforce development for Maine's economy in entry level, technical and leadership positions \textbf{(SVV 1.2.3 \& 1.2.4)}.

GREG PORTER My research on potato cropping systems, supplemental irrigation, and nutrient management has resulted in improved recommendations for potato producers and processors.  Improved management practices and varieties help potato growers produce an affordable, high quality potato crop with as little environmental impact as possible.  More profitable agricultural systems can help stimulate the rural economy and maintain open space. My research helps growers use inputs efficiently thus minimizing impact on the environment and conserving soil resources.

RACHEL SCHATTMAN Results from the 2020 Maine Agriculture Drought Survey: I led a survey in the winter of 2020-2021, targeting Maineâ€™s biggest commodities (potatoes, wild blueberries) and other important agricultural sectors (diversified vegetable and small fruit, tree fruit, maple, hemp, livestock and dairy, nursery and greenhouse producers). The survey instrument was collaboratively developed by a team of agricultural advisors and service providers from the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry (MDACF), the University of Maine Extension, the University of Maine School of Food and Agriculture, and the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association (MOFGA)
My research on drought impacts in the state of Maine has been used by the Maine Water Board to assess the impact of the 2020 drought on agriculture. The Board
has been discussing advocating for funding to support farmers' ability to access water during periods of drought without degrading natural resources or ecosystems.  The report offers key recommendations for how to accomplish this goal.  More broadly, my work seeks to accelerate the rate of climate adaptation and mitigation in land use sectors. I predict that, without support or resources, many land managers will be ill prepared to contend with climate change challenges. By investing in research that (a) documents limitations to adaptation and mitigation, (b) supports land manager communities of practice around climate change adaptation and mitigation, and (c) integrates the best climate science with the place-based expertise of farmers and foresters, we can better prepare for the challenges ahead. By extension, this will support the long term viability of agriculture and forestry

Maine's potato industry working closely with GREG PORTER, has greatly increased the value of it's holdings through development of the Caribou Russet and Pinto Gold \textbf{(SVV 2.1.1)}. In part, through our relationship with Cooperative Extension and 4H, faculty such as KATE YERXA, DAVE MARCINKOWSKI, ANNE LICHTENWALNER, LILY CALDERWOOD, and HOBSON MACHADO, have been closely involved with local communities, businesses, and schools to address need in community health and nutrition, dairy farm and agricultural profitability, zoonotic diseases, and educational programming \textbf{(SVV 2.1.2)}.

%The School of Food and Agriculture either controls, or uses heavily, certain infrastructure assets which align with the University's mission. The Analytical Laboratory, supervised by SUE ERICH, plays an important role in sustaining the agricultural economy throughout the North East, and employs several highly skilled staff in the analysis of submitted soil samples on a fee for service basis in a relatively low foot print in Deering hall. In addition, STEPHANIE BURNETT and BRYAN PETERSON are heavily involved with the use and  maintenance of the Roger Clapp Green Houses, which sustain a valuable ornamental plant collection, and make possible nationally recognized horticultural research and educational programming for UMaine students and the community. The recently completed Veterinary Diagnostic laboratory, supervised by ANNE LICHTENWALNER, provides state of the art diagnostics on a fee for service basis.

\textbf{Summary}\\~\\
%In spite of gains made last year, AY 2020-2021  will be challenging due to the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic. Led by the SAG faculty, we are transitioning to Brightspace for the upcoming year, and will be prepared to teach classes online as required, while remaining flexible to manage face-to-face instruction. The diversity of our unit is one of its strengths, and we hope to build on that strength as we move forward with campus wide initiatives to embrace diversity, equity and inclusion. We will continue to explore ways to sustain and increase enrollment. One possibility under consideration is to reach out to urban youth, for whom a degree from SFA may be a key step in upward mobility. With several retirements on the horizon we must maintain our focus on recruitment of new faculty, with the pressing need for a new research faculty member in FSN, and an instructor in AVS.  \\~\\
