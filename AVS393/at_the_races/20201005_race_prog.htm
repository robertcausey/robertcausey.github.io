<B><I>Please note: this exercise is not intended to encourage you to bet. It is intended for you to learn how performance of a racehorse is recorded, and how the betting process works. This knowledge is valuable if you wish to be professionally involved in the racing industry, perhaps as a veterinarian, farrier, trainer, groom, judge, regulator, racing secretary, etc, or involved in racing data management.<p></I></B><P> 
Please follow this link if you would like to know more about gambling addiction. I am not qualified to discuss it from a clinical perspective, but you should be aware that the problem exists.<p>
