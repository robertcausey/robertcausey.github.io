<B>Students with Disabilities:</B><BR>
If you have a disability for which you may be requesting an accommodation, please contact either myself or Ann Smith, Coordinator of Services for Students with Disabilities (Onward Building, 581-2319), as early as possible in the semester.
<P>
<B>Academic Honesty Statement:</B><br>Academic honesty is very important. It is dishonest to cheat on exams, to copy term papers, to submit papers written by another person, to fake experimental results, or to copy or reword parts of books or articles into your own papers without appropriately citing the source. Students committing or aiding in any of these violations may be given failing grades for an assignment or for an entire course, at the discretion of the instructor. In addition to any academic action taken by an instructor, these violations are also subject to action under the University of Maine Student Conduct Code.  The maximum possible sanction under the student conduct code is dismissal from the University.Please see the University of Maine System’s Academic Integrity Policy  listed in the Board Policy Manual as Policy 314: https://www.maine.edu/board-of-trustees/policy-manual/section-314/<P> 
<B>Students Accessibility Services Statement:</B><br>If you have a disability for which you may be requesting an accommodation, please contact Student Accessibility Services, 121 East Annex, 581.2319, as early as possible in the term. Students who have already been approved for accommodations by SAS and have a current accommodation letter should meet with me (Robert Causey) privately as soon as possible.<P>
<B>Course Schedule Disclaimer (Disruption Clause):</B><br>In the event of an extended disruption of normal classroom activities (due to COVID-19 or other long-term disruptions), the format for this course may be modified to enable its completion within its programmed time frame. In that event, you will be provided an addendum to the syllabus that will supersede this version.<P> 
<B>Observance of Religious Holidays/Events:</B><br>The University of Maine recognizes that when students are observing significant religious holidays, some may be unable to attend classes or labs, study, take tests, or work on other assignments. If they provide adequate notice (at least one week and longer if at all possible), these students are allowed to make up course requirements as long as this effort does not create an unreasonable burden upon the instructor, department or University. At the discretion of the instructor, such coursework could be due before or after the examination or assignment. No adverse or prejudicial effects shall result to a student’s grade for the examination, study, or course requirement on the day of religious observance. The student shall not be marked absent from the class due to observing a significant religious holiday. In the case of an internship or clinical, students should refer to the applicable policy in place by the employer or site.<P>

<center>UNIVERSITY OF MAINE COVID-19 SYLLABUS STATEMENT</center><P>
 </B><p>
COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The virus is transmitted person-to-person through respiratory droplets that are expelled when breathing, talking, eating, coughing, or sneezing. Additionally, the virus is stable on surfaces and can be transmitted when someone touches a contaminated surface and transfers the virus to their nose or mouth. When someone becomes infected with COVID-19 they may either have no symptoms or symptoms that range from mild to severe and can even be fatal. During this global pandemic, it is imperative that all students, faculty, and staff abide by the safety protocols and guidelines set forth by the University to ensure the safety of our campus. All students are encouraged to make the Black Bear Cares Pact to protect the health of themselves, the health of others, and the College of Our Hearts Always.<p>
Black Bears Care Pact: https://umaine.edu/return/black-bears-care/ <P>
<B>Symptom checking:</B><br> The symptoms of COVID-19 can range from mild to severe, and even people with mild symptoms may transmit the virus to others. Students are encouraged to use the symptom checking app each day before attending class or moving about campus and follow the recommendation prompted within the app. Students should monitor for the following symptoms daily: fever (temperature greater than 100.4F/38.0C) or chills, new cough, loss of taste or smell, shortness of breath/difficult breathing, sore throat, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting, or the onset of new, otherwise unexplained symptoms such as headache, muscle or body aches, fatigue, or congestion/runny nose.<P>
<B>Physical distancing:</B><br>Students need to make every effort to maintain physical distancing (6 feet or more) indoors and outdoors including within classrooms. The University classrooms and physical spaces have been arranged to maximize physical distancing. Follow the traffic patterns outlined in each building and outdoor space to avoid crowding. If students are in an academic setting (i.e. clinical or lab class) that requires them to reduce physical distancing, they should follow the instructor’s guidelines.<P>
<B>Face coverings: </B><br>Students must wear appropriate face coverings in the classroom. Face coverings must be worn in indoor and outdoor spaces on campus unless people are alone in a room with a door closed or when they are properly physically distanced and do not expect someone to approach them. When face coverings are removed people are placing themselves and those surrounding them at increased risk for COVID-19.<P>
<B>Physical distancing: </B><br>Students need to make every effort to maintain physical distancing (6 feet or more) indoors and outdoors including within classrooms. The University classrooms and physical spaces have been arranged to maximize physical distancing. Follow the traffic patterns outlined in each building and outdoor space to avoid crowding.
