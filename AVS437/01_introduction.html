<h1>01_Describing Disease</h1>
<B>Introduction</B>
<blockquote>
Welcome to Animal Diseases. In this first lecture I wish to cover two topics as back ground. The first is to provide a brief introduction into how we describe disease in populations. The second is to review the anatomy of some of the body's barriers to disease, especially infectious disease.
</blockquote>
<B>Describing Disease</B>
<blockquote>
Most of us think of disease as something which occurs in an individual animal or individual person. However, diseases should be thought of as something <em>occurring in a population</em>. Not only are some diseases spread between thousands of animals, but thousands of animals may be exposed to a particular toxin or environmental condition which causes illness. The result is that diseases almost always occur in some but not all animals in a population, making it a complicated situation to analyze. <p>
As veterinarians we are interested in how widespread and severe a disease is, so we can make appropriate plans to address an outbreak. To do so we will use terms like Incidence, Prevalence, Morbidity, and Mortality to describe magnitude and severity of disease in a population. But also we wish to assess the possible causes of disease, and to identify what led to a disease outbreak, so we can prevent it. In this case we can talk about Risk Factors, Relative Risk, and Odds Ratios.<p>
<B>Incidence</B><P>
<A HREF=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hus/sources-definitions/incidence.htm#print>Incidence</A> measures the number of <em>new</em> cases of a disease which occur over a specified period of time. It is particularly useful in monitoring outbreaks of an infectious disease, such as the recent discovery of <A HREF=https://www.avma.org/news/cat-deaths-linked-bird-flu-contaminated-raw-pet-food-sparking-voluntary-recall>H5N1 influenza virus in undercooked cat food</A>.<p> 
<B>Prevalence</B><P>
<A HREF=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/what-is-prevalence#part_2624>Prevalence</A> 
measures how common a particular condition is at a given point in time, location, or particular population. It is useful in measuring chronic conditions or diseases which arise and are maintained by individuals in a population, such as <A HREF=https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5366211/> hip-dysplasia</A> in German Shepherds, or hypertension in old people like myself.<P>
<b>Morbidity</b><p>
<A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK547668/>Morbidity</A> is a measure of how many animals show illness, and may be described using incidence or prevalence. An interesting aspect of morbidity is that some animals that test positive or share a predisposition for the disease but may not exhibit any indications of illness (clinical signs). Similarly, some of you may know someone who tested positive for COVID but showed no indication of illness. If so they would not be counted as "morbid" or sick. We may carry many bacteria or viruses but not all of them, indeed perhaps few of them, cause disease or cause morbidity.<p>
<b>Mortality</b><p>
<A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK547668/>Mortality</A>, as its name suggests, is a measure of how many individuals die during a disease outbreak relative to the population as a whole, not relative to those who became sick. For those of you who are interested in these statistics you might enjoy perusing the Center for Disease Control's weekly Mortality and Morbidity <A HREF=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/mmwr_additional_resources.html>Report</A><p>  
<b>Relative Risk</b><p>
<A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Okiq7RKeFH5glRJFF-ceSYsp9fFL67H/view?usp=sharing/>"Risk"</A> is how we identify the cause of disease. In trying to understand the causes of flu we might say a possible causes of flu (a.k.a. risk factor) could be <em>Standing out in the rain</em>. To see if standing in the rain does indeed contribute to flu we could start by looking at a group of people who stand out in the rain as part of their work and record the incidence of flu over a given time period i.e. the number of new cases in a given period &#247 the total number exposed. This incidence may also be referred to as the Absolute Risk of catching flu in folks who stand out in the rain. <p>
For comparison we could also follow the Absolute Risk for folks who are not exposed to rain by measuring the incidence of flu over the same period of time in <em>folks who work indoors</em>. We could then compare the incidence of flu in those who stood out in the rain (exposed) to the incidence of flu in those who stayed indoors (unexposed). If the incidence of flu in the rain group is higher than the indoor group we can conclude that exposure to rain increases the risk of catching the flu i.e. rain is a risk factor for catching the flu. <p>
When we divide the incidence of the exposed by the unexposed (i.e. incidence of flu in rain &#247 incidence of flu indoors), if the number is &#62; 1, we can say there is a positive relative risk of catching the flu from standing out in the rain. If the number is &#60; 1 we can say that standing outside in the rain reduces the incidence of flu. If the number is 1, we would probably conclude that standing in the rain has no impact of whether you get the flu or not, or that we need to rethink how we approached the study.<P>
This study would be considered a Prospective Study. In this case we start by knowing the exposure and then we follow each group to collect the cases occur over the course of the study. Because we plan the study and then watch the cases emerge we consider this a watch-what-will-happen kind of experiment. Hence we call it a PRO-spective study in which we follow two cohorts of patients, the "exposed" and the "unexposed", and collect data on them over the course of the study, expecting to see greater numbers of cases in the exposed cohort. This approach is also used in clinical trials to show drug safety and efficacy, however, in this case we would hope to see <em>fewer</em> cases of disease in the exposed cohort, because the exposure was to receive a drug treatment we hope would reduce cases of disease.<p>
<b>Odds and Odds Ratios</b><p>
An alternative way of conducting the study is to imagine you work in the ER at Eastern Maine Medical Center and see folks coming in with the flu. As a young resident clinician you would like to do a small study to test your hunch that people standing out in the rain get flu. A way to approach this is to select patients you have seen with the flu and ask them if they have been out in the rain recently. As a comparison, for each person with the flu, you select one or more control patients who do not have the flu as matches for each case, but are similar to the case in all other respects. You then also ask the controls if they have been out in the rain. <p>
For all the cases and controls who worked in the rain (the exposed group), you compute the odds that they got the flu (exposed cases&#247;exposed controls), and in those who did not stand out in the rain you also compute the odds that they got the flu (unexposed cases&#247;unexposed controls). You then compute the <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Okiq7RKeFH5glRJFF-ceSYsp9fFL67H/view?usp=sharing/>Odds Ratio</A>, which is the odds of getting flu if you are in the rain &#247; the odds of getting flu if you are not in the rain. Like relative risk, if the Odds Ratio is &#62; 1 then we can say that standing out side increases the likelihood of getting the flu. If the Odds Ratio is &#60; 1 we can say that standing out in the rain reduces the likelihood of getting the flu.<p>
This type of study, known as a Case-Control study, is considered a retrospective study, because we plan the study to look at exposure that occurred prior to the conducting the study. We already know who has the disease; we are looking back to identify if previous exposure caused it, hence it is a RETRO-spective study.

I have performed the <A HREF=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W8ecfUZtX5Fks41MYBxFVkQuUyWmQBIn-bX1ykqlXFc/edit?usp=sharing> calculations to estimate relative risk and odd-ratio</A> for imaginary prospective and retrospective studies on the possible link between standing in the rain and getting flu. These are based on the <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Okiq7RKeFH5glRJFF-ceSYsp9fFL67H/view?usp=drive_link>excellent paper</A> by Chittaranjan Andrade, MD.<p>

<b>Anatomical Barriers to Disease</b>
<blockquote>
One of the first lines of defense against disease are the anatomical barriers that are in close contact with the environment. Most commonly we think of the respiratory and digestive system as the primary example. But other parts of the body find themselves on the front line. These include the skin, the eye, lymphatic structures such as the tonsils, the blood itself, the monocyte-macrophage system, the liver, and many others.<p>
<b>The Skin</b><p>
The skin (or integument) comes in all shapes and size, both across different species, but also across different parts of the same individual animal. Skin has a keratinized <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/14LhMiCDdxF2QrTDxpfz-lE1QZTCSPXu9/view?usp=sharing>stratified squamous epithelium</A>, which means multiple layers of flat, tile-like cells, laying on top of each other. In skin, these cells are reinforced with keratin, the key protein of skin, horns, hooves, foot pads, and callouses.  At the junction of the digestive, respiratory, and reproductive tracts, the keratinized epithelium may become a "mucous membrane" due to fluid coating the oral epithelium  <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ArzGVu3dWmAUcccv0tjuQgI5kTqMdt-U/view?usp=sharing>e.g. in sheep</A>, but still retains the stratified squamous architecture. The stratified squamous epithelium that is keratinized is remarkably impermeable. However, the presence of <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k4_uiUzapclCNg3BjDEwH4eQYQNqLe5P/view?usp=sharing>sweat glands(4)</A>in the digital pad of dogs and cats and <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KAEr3n9CTm9_zlNMocIHeP8VQz-C_lpN/view?usp=sharing>hair follicles</A> may serve as a "nidus" or "nest" for infection to get started.<p>   
<b>The Respiratory Tract</b><p>
The opening to the respiratory tract is the nose. Anatomically, we call the inner air passage way the <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_5wWaN2NvO7sB-wMYUexDZgqvpzqoILx/view?usp=sharing>nasopharynx</A>. For a few millimetres the lining is a non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium (pink), but it quickly switches to a <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VMz7TY7sYkTMKoQfeH-1r76PZe9xCb-_/view?usp=sharing>pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium (8)</A> which includes <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qvhM2DEuMfXsUUbhEj3Kq8sZaWlAsScH/view?usp=sharing>ciliated cells, and goblet (mucus producing)</A> cells. The cilia, beating hairs, are a critically important part of defense, because they sweep the mucous secretion from goblet cells out of the nose. The mucus catches bacteria, viruses etc. The secretions also carry IgA antibodies, which are unique to mucous membranes, and play a key role in immunity to respiratory infections, such as flu, COVID etc. We will discuss antibodies later in the semester. Initial mucosal defenses include lysozyme and cationic antimicrobial proteins (CAMPs), including defensins, which break down bacterial cells walls. The mucociliary escalator continues into the <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-bThdgpeLOvRdj-wfCGiMzIDDIaVrg2V/view?usp=sharing>trachea</A> and <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zH89BITACvVXxz61Mm72P_1MTF4HB2zM/view?usp=sharing>bronchi(11)  and bronchioles(7)</A> but disappears in the <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NeTPBFzmLGnTQxhS9J6Sm5gNJAUPvBI8/view?usp=sharing>alveoli(3)</A> where we see a new cell takes up guard duty, the <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rUUvPhT9YQIEGCtq1FEXx0TLoOgObYZZ/view?usp=sharing>alveolar macrophage(7)</A>. This phagocytic antigen presenting cell is the last line of defense at the alveolar surface.<P>
<B>The Digestive Tract</B><p>
There are, to my knowledge, no cilia in the digestive tract. The reason is that food and digesta are so heavy and fibrous that cilia would be rendered ineffective. There are, however, many mucus producing goblet cells. This mucus provides an environment for beneficial bacteria and protozoa to do their stuff, especially breaking down fiber in the rumen (in cattle) or large intestine (horse). But a large population of <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iVN01E5NV59J2CesR0DQj2IOb70aj09J/view?usp=sharing>lymphocytes(6)</A> (cells which coordinate and produce antibodies, including IgA at mucosal surfaces) help to keep the vast microbial population in check. If too much glucose, or easily digestible carbohydrate, is consumed by herbivores, such as horses or ruminants, microbial overgrowth can occur, leading to toxemia and possibly death. In addition, high gastric acidity is an important defense against microbes.<p>
The liver receives blood from the intestine via the hepatic portal vein, and filters potentially toxic products of digestion such as bacteria, bacterial endotoxins, and other debris from the circulation. The <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JTVkH0rJIbb7rnhjLHIA3DqT5jf4drlT/view?usp=sharing>Kupffer Cells (8)</A> in the liver form the largest tissue bed of macrophages in the body, and play a major role in the detoxification of the raw materials of digestion. The Kupffer cells are part of the mononuclear phagocyte system (see below).<p>    
 <B>The Blood</B><p>
Blood consists of plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. White blood cells are divided into granulocytes (<A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rjMDdYMQ8LtbSEg5JBTzZuZqZub2TrRh/view?usp=sharing>neutrophils(5), eosinophils(2), basophils(1), plus platelets(6)</A>), and "mononuclear"  cells i.e. <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gB6EDTuuY-TCStoOXjXWERPhFpXvKUQL/view?usp=sharing>lymphocytes(5), and monocytes(7)</A>. All of these are responsible for fighting infection in some way or other. The monocytes are essential for the <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mononuclear_phagocyte_system>mononuclear phagocyte system</A>, a network of phagocytic macrophages derived from or replenished by circulating monocytes</A>.  These cells phagocytize potential pathogens and present antigens to the immune system to invoke production of antibodies and cell mediated immunity.<p>   
<b>Tonsils</b><p>
The <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sIT6bJnWIc2ihP4_UcNaneR6vOJhPFwa/view?usp=sharing>Tonsils</A> are part of a network of lymphocytic structures, including lymph nodes, which play a role in generating an immune response to pathogens. Lymph nodes are comprised of lymphocytes <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gB6EDTuuY-TCStoOXjXWERPhFpXvKUQL/view?usp=sharing>lymphocytes (5)</A>, and are found at particular parts of the body from which they coordinate the immune response. For example, lymph nodes may be enlarged during an infection, such as our submandibular (under-the-jaw) lymph nodes when we have a cold. I noticed that my pre-scapular lymph nodes (along the border of the shoulder blade, between your shoulder and your neck) would swell up after a COVID vaccination. I assumed that was a good sign, since it meant the vaccine was working.<p>
The Palatine tonsils are unusual among lymph nodes because they contain <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s5uhPLx-Ziverf7oiHiP-FRRb--oWTCG/view?usp=sharing>crypts (3)</A> which <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sGlETwvDdTihrqY8Gn5TpqW4gQ9pxfsK/view?usp=sharing>open directly(3)</A> into the oropharynx, leaving lymphocytes exposed to potential pathogens. This allows for rapid presentation of invading organisms to the immune system, but also provides a gateway for some pathogens, including <em>streptococci</em> and <em>salmonella</em>, to slip through the body's defenses.<p>
<b>The Eye</b><p>
The <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dqEQ3U_RUFsjCt8BjssnUiiOwjbbD3Jr/view?usp=sharing>eye </A>has a unique boundary with the environment. The <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/113usYN130B6XVyFkb38S5KZ85oxEGHHg/view?usp=sharing>conjunctiva(14 and 1)</A> is the <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-ATGEqyo91Xe4har3ujc5g286888E3_g/view?usp=sharing>stratified squamous</A> non-keratinized mucous membrane surrounding the eye (the pink of the eye) and is directly exposed to the environment, including dust and pathogens. Similarly, the <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/15wTZmFF0qQF_QaNvkkCeEs1vo0ReyYC4/view?usp=sharing>cornea</A> is a unique structure covering the anterior chamber. Both are regions susceptible to infection. Inflammation of the conjunctiva is called conjuctivitis. The <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/113usYN130B6XVyFkb38S5KZ85oxEGHHg/view?usp=sharing>uveal tract(18)</A> supplies blood to the sclera and iris, and is deeper than the conjunctiva. Inflammation of the uveal tract is called uveitis and is more serious.
