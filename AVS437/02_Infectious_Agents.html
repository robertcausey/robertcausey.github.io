<h1>02_Infectious Agents</h1>
<B>Introduction</B>
<Blockquote>
In this module on infectious agents we will survey the primary infectious diseases of domestic animals, specifically viruses, bacteria, and fungi. The approach will be to provide a classification of these pathogens, so that you can appreciate the full spectrum. You can then start to fill in the gaps with examples from this class, and improve your knowledge after this course, such as when you get to veterinary college or graduate school.<p>

<B>Viruses</B>
<Blockquote>
<A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8174/>Viruses </A>are a remarkable class of pathogens. By definition a virus contains either an RNA or DNA genome surrounded by a protective, virus-coded protein coat. They are primarily classified according to 1. Morphology, and 2. Their chemical composition/mode of <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8181/>replication.</A><p>They are obligate intracellular "parasites", which means that they must hi-jack the machinery of a host cell to create new viruses. The host cell, using viral nucleic acid, will then synthesize viral proteins, the viral genome, and in some cases create a protective membrane (envelope) when the virus buds out of a cell. The first virus identified using electron microscopy was the tobacco mosaic virus by the combined efforts of <A HREF=https://nobelprizemuseum.se/en/viruses-captured-in-photos/> Ernst and Helmut Ruska</A> in the late 1930's in Germany. <p>  
<B><A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8174/table/A2257/?report=objectonly>Viral Classification</A></B><p>
Virus families have a descriptor prefix followed by the suffix -viridae. For example Corona-viridae are so named due to their crown (i.e. corona) like appearance on electron microscopy.  Detailed classification of viruses is based on the following:
<blockquote>
<B>Viral Genome</B> - The genetic material of viruses is comprised of DNA or RNA, single or double stranded, linear or circular. If single stranded, it is further classified as sense or anti-sense (sense means the nucleotide sequence on the RNA that undergoes transcription. Antisense means it is the complementary strand (or opposite strand) that the sense strand is synthesized from). Sense RNA may be synthesized from DNA (using a DNA dependent RNA polymerase), or from RNA (using an RNA dependent RNA polymerase).<p>
<B>Envelope</B> - Viruses can leave the cell in at least two ways. One way is to cause cell lysis i.e. the cell ruptures and virus particles are released as free floating particles. A second way is that viruses are shed through the cell membrane, and carry a covering of the cell membrane with them (the envelope). The <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8174/figure/A2262/?report=objectonly>viral envelope</A> frequently contain proteins synthesized by the virus. Thus viruses may be classified according to whether they have an envelope or not. The HIV virus has an envelope which is created when the virus <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VqI0_VsSAJpROZc1FPCjDKsba9Qk45iN/view?usp=sharing>buds</A> from the infected lymphocyte.<P>
<B>Capsid Symmetry</b> - Some of the proteins of the virus bind to or enclose the DNA in as compact covering. This covering is known as the "capsid", and individual components of the capsid are called capsomeres. Capsomeres may be thought of as protein crystals, with a very regular shape. When enclosing the viral genome, the capsomeres essentially <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8174/figure/A2265/?report=objectonly>"crystallize"</A> around the nucleic acid in a geometrically repeatable way. The symmetry may be spiral, with the capsomeres following the spiral of the nucleic acid, or the symmetry may be <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8174/figure/A2264/?report=objectonly>icosahedral</A>, a structure made from 20 equilateral triangles. The icosahedron has fivefold, threefold, and twofold axes of rotational symmetry or "5,3,2 symmetry".<p>
<B>Site of Capsid Assembly</B> - The viral capsid binds to the nucleic acid and "crystallizes" into its final form in either the cell nucleus (most common for DNA viruses), or cytoplasm (all RNA viruses and a few DNA viruses).<p>
<B>Special viral enzymes for transcription</B> - Some DNA viruses are able to use the cell's RNA polymerase to create mRNA for transcription. However, other DNA viruses carry their own DNA dependent RNA polymerase. Some RNA viruses have an antisense genome, in which case they will require an RNA dependent RNA polymerase. Viruses with a sense RNA genome do not need to synthesize RNA because the sense strand can serve as the messenger RNA.<p>
The retroviruses are unique in that they synthesize DNA from their viral RNA genome (a sense strand). This involves an RNA dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase). The DNA then is incorporated into the cells DNA (as a "provirus"), and then is transcribed by the cells machinery to produce viral proteins. This method of replication (RNA --> DNA) is in the opposite direction of the central dogma of molecular biology (DNA--> RNA--> Protein).

<B><A HREF=https://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Disinfection/Assets/VirusFamilyTable.pdf>Survey of Important Animal Disease Viruses</A></B><P>
Below is a brief summary of the more important viral families:<P>
<Center> <B>ENVELOPED VIRUSES</center></B>
<Blockquote>
<B>Arteriviridae</B> - This group includes Equine Viral Arteritis and Porcine Respiratory and Reproductive Syndrome (PRRS).<P>
<B>Coronaviridae</B> - Coronaviruses are common in a variety of species, including cattle, dogs, cats, and horses. Mostly they cause diarrhea, but play a role in Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP). Coronavirus as a disease in horses is seen as a transitory diarrhea. Porcine Coronovirus is responsible for Transmissible Gastroenteritis in Pigs, a serious disease. The SARS CoV-2 COVID 19 can infect many domestic animals.<P>
<B>Flaviviridae</B> - Includes several important viruses, including Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVD), St Louis Encephalitis Virus, West Nile Virus, and several tick-borne encephalitis viruses.<P>
<B>Herpesviridae</B> - This is one of the largest and most important family of viruses, causing disease in a variety of species. Conditions include Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR), Feline Viral Rhinotracheitis, Equine Rhinopneumonitis, Canine Herpes Virus, Pseudorabies, Marek's disease in chickens and many more. Herpes viruses also infect humans, including human cytomegalovirus, the Epstein_Barr Virus which causes infectious mononucleosis ("mono"), and chicken pox virus (Varicella-Zoster virus) which also causes shingles. Herpes viruses tend to infect nerve cells, and can remain latent until a stressor causes the virus to "recrudesce", as we find when we get cold sores from the herpes simplex virus.<p>
<B>Orthomyxoviridae</B> - This represents the influenza family of viruses, including Avian, Equine, Canine, and Swine Influenza. It should be noted that avian influenza can also infect chickens, horses, and swine. It is interesting that Infectious Salmon Anemia is also in this family of viruses.<p>
<B>Paramyxoviridae</B> - These viruses include several respiratory pathogens, including Bovine Parainfluenza, Canine Distemper and Parainfluenza, Measles (Morbillivirus), and Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus.<p> 
<B>Poxviridae</B> - This includes the pox viruses (but not chicken pox in people). It includes Cow Pox and the Vaccinia virus from which the word vaccine is derived. Pox viruses infect many species.<p>
<B>Retroviridae</B> - This includes the "HIV-like" viruses which infect most domestic species. They include immunodeficiency viruses (BIV, FIV) and leukemia viruses (BLV, FelV). Also in this group is equine infectious anemia for which the coggins test was developed. The retroviridae are unique in possessing a RNA dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase) which causes insertion of viral DNA (pro-virus) into the host genome.<p>
<B>Rhabdoviridae</B> - This group includes rabies (affecting all mammals) and vesicular stomatitis in pigs.<p>
<B>Togaviridae</B> - BVD used to be in this group, but has been reclassified in the flaviviruses. Currently the group includes the major Equine Encephalitis viruses (Eastern, Western, and Venezuelan). Like several flaviviruses, the equine encephalitis viruses are spread by mosquitoes and can potentially infect people.<p>
<center><B>NON-ENVELOPED VIRUSES</B></CENTER><P>
<B>Adenoviridae</B> - These viruses tend to cause hepatitis in a variety of species (including cattle, dogs and horses and several other domestic animals.<P>
<B>Papilloma Viruses</B> - This group includes the wart producing viruses in cattle and horses.<P>
<B>Reoviridae</B> - This group includes serious diseases such as African Horse Sickness, Bluetongue in ruminants, epizootic hemorrhagic disease in cattle, cervids and sheep. Rotaviruses, which infect newborns in several species, are in this group. <P>
<B>Caliciviridae</B> - Caliciviruses are important as cat respiratory pathogen for which we vaccinate.<p>
<B>Parvoviridae</B> - Parvoviruses cause serious gastroenteritis in puppies, and panleukopenia in cats.<p>
<B>Picornaviridae</B> - Rhinoviruses comprise a major group of this group, that includes the common cold. But the group also includes foot-and-mouth disease, bovine enterovirus, swine vesicular disease, encephalomyelocarditis virus (attacking brain, spinal cord and heart)! and the polio virus. Makes me wonder about the common-cold...

<B>Bacteria</B><P>
As you know, Bacteria are also important pathogens. In this section we will briefly review history of the germ theory of disease, and the stucture and classification of the major bacterial pathogens.
<Blockquote>
<B>Proving the Germ Theory of Disease</B><P>  
In the mid 19th century our knowledge of infectious diseases started to progress rapidly, leading to the <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_theory_of_disease#>Germ Theory</A> of disease. In 1843 <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Wendell_Holmes_Sr.>Oliver Wendell Holmes</A> in Massachusetts independently linked child-bed fever (<A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpartum_infections>puerperal fever</A>) to poor biosecurity practices of <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NFb_JWPG7LHJpCMe_AKVsnTniS6vn6FL/view?usp=sharing>local physicians</A>. Shortly after, in 1846, <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis>Ignaz Semmelweis</A> in Vienna showed a difference in mortality in <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis#/media/File:Yearly_mortality_rates_1841-1846_two_clinics.png>two clinics</A> (one for residents, the other for midwives) and demonstrated a dramatic reduction in incidence due to <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis#/media/File:Monthly_mortality_rates_1841-1849.png>hand-washing</A>. The causative agent, was later identified as a <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5088015/><em>"Streptococcus"</em></A> by the Austrian Surgeon <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Billroth>Theodor Billroth</A> at the same hospital in which Semmelweis had worked.<p>
<A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow>John Snow</A> became known as the founder of modern epidemiology through his study of the <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1854_Broad_Street_cholera_outbreak>1854 Broad Street Cholera</A> outbreak in London, where he showed that cholera was not spread by a miasma (bad air) but through the fecal oral route. He showed that a particular water pump, which drew water from the Thames river, into which people poured their sewage, was the source of contamination. In comparison, a pump fed from water further up river, fed from a well, had a significantly lower incidence. Interestingly, workers at a brewery supplied with contaminated water did not contract cholera due to their water being boiled prior to adding hops. His conclusion, that cholera was spread through the water, was not accepted at first. Since then, however, his views have been proved correct, and a <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow_(public_house)>pub</A> has been named after him at the site of the water pump in London. Here are <A HREF=https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d3531560-Reviews-John_Snow_Public_House-London_England.html>reviews</A>. We now know that the causative agent of the outbreak was <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrio_cholerae><em>Vibrio cholerae</em></A><P>
The result from these and other studies of bacterial disease was the development and acceptance of the Germ Theory of Disease by scientists such as Louis Pasteur, Ilya Metchinikoff, Jules Bordet, and Robert Koch. There work was based almost exclusively on bacterial studies. For example, <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Pasteur>Louis Pasteur</A>, after whom the <A HREF=https://www.pasteur.fr/en/institut-pasteur/history>Institut Pasteur</A> in Paris is named, disproved the theory of spontaneous generation, using boiled broth in <A HREF=https://blog.cmog.org/2016/savior-swans-neck-or-how-simple-glass-flask-saved-millions-lives>swan necked flasks</A>.<P>
Given opposition to the germ theory of disease, Robert Koch made a stringent system by which the bacterial basis of disease would be irrefutable. <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch%27s_postulates>Koch's postulates</A> stipulate that to be classified a pathogen, four postulates must be met:<P> 
1. The organism was only found in sick individuals, not healthy individuals<BR>
2. The organism could be isolated and grown in pure culture<BR>
3. The cultured organism could cause disease when introduced into a healthy individual<BR> 
4. The organism could be reisolated from the experimental host and identified as the original causative agent.<P>
However, Koch's Postulates do not apply to all infectious diseases, since we now know that individuals may carry diseases without showing clinical signs. Examples include Cholera, Typhoid, Streptococcal infections and several others. The Irish cook in New York known as "Typhoid Mary", <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Mallon>Mary Mallon</A> is a classic example. Nevertheless, bacterial pathogens have been critical in helping us understand the epidemiology of infectious diseases, and Koch's postulates convinced skeptics of the key role of pathogenic bacteria.<P>
<B>Structure and classification of Bacteria</B><P>
Bacteria are <A HREF=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/gene-expression-and-regulation/dna-and-rna-structure/a/prokaryote-structure>prokaryotic</A> organisms which do not have a nucleus, but have their DNA dispersed through the cytoplasm. The most fundamental way to classify them is by the <A HREF=https://www.atsu.edu/faculty/chamberlain/mosdoh/gramstainingrules.htm>Gram Stain method</A>, which distinguishes bacteria based on the <A HREF=https://byjus.com/biology/difference-between-gram-positive-and-gram-negative-cell-wall/>cell wall</A>. Bacteria may therefore be classified as Gram Positive or Gram Negative.<P>
In addition, bacteria may be classified as Cocci or Rods. Thus we may refer to Gram positive Cocci, Gram posotive rods, Gram negative Cocci (very rare), or Gram negative Rods (very, very comommon).  Bacteria also have a variety of additional structures, such as <A HREF=https://microbeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pili-and-conjugation.jpg>pili</A>, <A HREF=https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3cb50982d2d9bc329ad1b84b51c85434.webp>fimbri, flagella</A>, <A HREF=https://media.sciencephoto.com/image/b2201051/400wm>capsules</A>, and<A HREF=https://cdn-fgnif.nitrocdn.com/DXTfpExRWnFuRKBvfNFPNrfazQrUitPW/assets/mobile/optimized/rev-e5d2976/biokimicroki.com/wp-content/36039c5f2c956c4d172210263f58c37f.webpc-passthru.php>spores</A> in a variety of <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK556071/>species</A>. <P>

<B><A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6251577/>Fungi</A></B><P>
Fungi are an important group of pathogens. Frequently we can see fungal overgrowth after extensive use of antibiotics has eliminated the normal flora. In addition, fungal spores can cause significant respiratory infections. This is a very brief overview of fungi and fungal infections.
<Blockquote>
<B><A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/19UJK0g2ejBxo9PTuMU5zPilH7y_mHzpa/view?usp=sharing>Classification</A></B><P>
Fungi may take the appearance of yeasts (single celled organisms) versus molds (multicellular organisms with hyphae). However, several species (e.g. <em>Candida albicans</em>) are dimorphic, having both yeast and hyphal forms. The primary basis of classification of fungi is whether the hyphae are septate (cells separated by a cell wall), or aseptate (there is no cell wall)<P>
<A HREF=https://search.library.wisc.edu/digital/ATCP4273TD7FYM8I><B>Aseptate fungi</B></A> include the <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5095542/>chytrid fungi</a> which have become important pathogens of <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batrachochytrium_dendrobatidis>amphibians</A>, causing several species to become extinct. Chytridmycoses are considered an emerging disease. Aseptate fungi also includes <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6078412/>Zygomycetes</A>, which are essentially soil fungi which cause economically significant pre- and postharvest diseases of fruits, form symbioses with more than 80% of land plants, and can be  pathogens or commensals of insects, nematodes, and other soil invertebrates<P>
<A HREF=https://i0.wp.com/www.differencebetween.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Difference-Between-Septate-and-Aseptate-Hyphae_Figure-1.jpg>Septate_fungi</A> include the following phyla:

They play a role in cheese making, including the blue veins in <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roquefort>Roquefort cheese</A> by <A HREF=https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2015-09/documents/fra008.pdf><em>Penicillium roqueforti</em></A> and the white crust on <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camembert>Camembert cheese</A> by <A HREF=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32976806/><em>Penicillium camemberti</em></A>. I was hoping there would be a <em>Penicillium stiltoni</em> but the French beat the English (Stilton), Italians (Gorgonzola), and the Danes (Danish Blue) to it.<P>  However, many imperfect fungi cause serious disease or produce toxins. These include <em> Trychophyton</em> and <em>Microsporum</em> which cause skin infections like athletes foot, ring worm, and <em>Aspergillus</em> which in turn can cause <A HREF=https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/aspergillosis/index.html#:~:text=Aspergillosis%20is%20an%20infection%20caused,every%20day%20without%20getting%20sick.>aspergillosis</A> a serious respiratory infection. In addition, <em>Aspergillus flavus</em> and <em>Aspergillus parasiticus</em> produce <A HREF=https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/aflatoxins#:~:text=Aflatoxins%20are%20a%20family%20of,humid%20regions%20of%20the%20world.>aflatoxins</A>, causing serious food poisoning and even liver cancer. Although the Deutermycota is no longer formally accepted phylum, and several of its members are now listed among the Ascomycota, the classification is helpful in understanding the historical grouping of these organsims. <P> 
<A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascomycota><B>Ascomycota</B></A>. This large group, also known as Sac fungi is characterized by an <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascus>"Ascus"</A> (i.e. sac or wineskin) which holds the sexually produced spores. The group contains organisms we commonly associate with yeasts, both beneficial and disease causing. For example, <em>Candida albicans</em> is in this group, and is a serious opportunistic infection that can be triggered by overuse of antibiotics. The causative agents of <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histoplasmosis>Histoplasmosis</A>, a soil borne disease that clusters along the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys, and is linked to caves and bat droppings.   <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccidioidomycosis>Coccidoidomycosis</A> (Valley Fever) which occurs in the hot desert soil of California, Arizona etc and in the San Joaquin valley. It can be the source of a community outbreaks of pneumonia after rain fall. Similarly, <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blastomycosis>Blastomycosis</A> occurs in the Eastern United states, along river valleys, and has a high incidence in dogs. <p> Interestingly this group also contains the benefical fungi of Brewer's and Baker's yeast <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em>, along with the genera <em>Penicillium</em> and <em>Aspergillus</em>. The ascomycete <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumocystis_jirovecii>Pneumocystis jiroveccii</A> can be an important pathogen of late-stage HIV patients. Interestingly, this phylum is also home to a large family of edible mushrooms, including <A HREF=https://www.allrecipes.com/article/what-are-morel-mushrooms/>morel mushrooms</A>.<P>
<A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basidiomycota><B>Basidiomycota</B></A>. The basidiomycetes include the classically shaped mushrooms we purchase at the supermarket and poisonous mushrooms we hopefully don't eat, such as the <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanita_phalloides>Death Cap</A> mushroom</A>, so named because of the resemblence to the cap worn by judges when delivering a death sentence. The toxic principle, amanitin, is an mRNA synthesis inhibitor, preventing the cell to synthesize proteins, leading to liver and kidney failure.<P>

Mushrooms from this phylum also produce the hallucinogen <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushroom>psilocybin</A>.
