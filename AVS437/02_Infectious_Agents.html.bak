<h1>02_Infectious Agents</h1>
<B>Introduction</B>
<Blockquote>
In this module on infectious agents we will survey the primary infectious diseases of domestic animals, specifically viruses, bacteria, and fungi. The approach will be to provide a classification of these pathogens, so that you can appreciate the full spectrum. You can then start to fill in the gaps with examples from this class, and improve your knowledge after this course, such as when you get to veterinary college or graduate school.<p>

<B>Viruses</B>
<Blockquote>
<A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8174/>Viruses </A>are a remarkable class of pathogens. By definition a virus contains either an RNA or DNA genome surrounded by a protective, virus-coded protein coat. They are primarily classified according to 1. Morphology, and 2. Their chemical composition/mode of <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8181/>replication.</A><p>They are obligate intracellular "parasites", which means that they must hi-jack the machinery of a host cell to create new viruses. The host cell, using viral nucleic acid, will then synthesize viral proteins, the viral genome, and in some cases create a protective membrane (envelope) when the virus buds out of a cell. The first virus identified using electron microscopy was the tobacco mosaic virus by the combined efforts of <A HREF=https://nobelprizemuseum.se/en/viruses-captured-in-photos/> Ernst and Helmut Ruska</A> in the late 1930's in Germany. <p>  
<B><A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8174/table/A2257/?report=objectonly>Viral Classification</A></B><p>
Virus families have a descriptor prefix followed by the suffix -viridae. For example Corona-viridae are so named due to their crown (i.e. corona) like appearance on electron microscopy.  Detailed classification of viruses is based on the following:
<blockquote>
<B>Viral Genome</B> - The genetic material of viruses is comprised of DNA or RNA, single or double stranded, linear or circular. If single stranded, it is further classified as sense or anti-sense (sense means the nucleotide sequence on the RNA that undergoes transcription. Antisense means it is the complementary strand (or opposite strand) that the sense strand is synthesized from). Sense RNA may be synthesized from DNA (using a DNA dependent RNA polymerase), or from RNA (using an RNA dependent RNA polymerase).<p>
<B>Envelope</B> - Viruses can leave the cell in at least two ways. One way is to cause cell lysis i.e. the cell ruptures and virus particles are released as free floating particles. A second way is that viruses are shed through the cell membrane, and carry a covering of the cell membrane with them (the envelope). The <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8174/figure/A2262/?report=objectonly>viral envelope</A> frequently containe proteins synthesized by the virus. Thus viruses may be classified according to whether they have an envelope or not. The HIV virus has an envelope which is created when the virus <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VqI0_VsSAJpROZc1FPCjDKsba9Qk45iN/view?usp=sharing>buds</A> from the infected lymphocyte.<P>
<B>Capsid Symmetry</b> - Some of the proteins of the virus bind to or enclose the DNA in as compact covering. This covering is known as the "capsid", and individual components of the capsid are called capsomeres. Capsomeres may be thought of as protein crystals, with a very regular shape. When enclosing the viral genome, the capsomeres essentially <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8174/figure/A2265/?report=objectonly>"crystallize"</A> around the nucleic acid in a gemometrically repeatable way. The symmetry may be spiral, with the capsomeres following the spiral of the nucleic acid, or the sysmmetry may be <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8174/figure/A2264/?report=objectonly>icosahedral</A>, a structure made from 20 equilateral triangles. The icosahedron has fivefold, threefold, and twofold axes of rotational symmetry or "5,3,2 symmetry".<p>
<B>Site of Capsid Assembly</B> - The viral capsid binds to the nucleic acid and "crystallizes" into its final form in either the cell nucleus (most common for DNA viruses), or cytoplasm (all RNA viruses and a few DNA viruses).<p>
<B>Special viral enzymes for transcription</B> - Some DNA viruses are able to use the cell's RNA polymerase to create mRNA for transcription. However, other DNA viruses carry their own DNA dependent RNA polymerase. Some RNA viruses have an antisense genome, in which case they will require an RNA dependent RNA polymerase. Viruses with a sense RNA genome do not need to synthesize RNA because the sense strand can serve as the messenger RNA.<p>
The retroviruses are unique in that they synthesize DNA from their viral RNA genome (a sense strand). This involves an RNA dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase). The DNA then is incorporated into the cells DNA (as a "provirus"), and then is transcribed by the cells machinery to produce viral proteins. Ths method of replication (RNA --> DNA) is in the opposite direction of the central dogma of molecular biology (DNA--> RNA--> Protein).

Below is a brief summary of the more important viral families:<P>
<Center> <B>ENVELOPED VIRUSES</center></B>
<Blockquote>
<B>Arteriviridae</B> - This group includes Equine Viral Arteritis and Porcine Respiratory and Reproductive Syndrome (PRRS).<P>
<B>Coronaviridae</B> - Coronaviruses are common in a variety of species, including cattle, dogs, cats, and horses. Mostly they cause diarrhea, but play a role in Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP). Coronavirus as a disease in horses is seen as a transitory diarrhea. Porcine Coronovirus is responsiible for Transmissible Gastroenteritis in Pigs, a serious disease. The SARS CoV-2 COVID 19 can infect many domestic animals.<P>
<B>Flaviviridae</B> - Includes several important viruses, including Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVD), St Louis Encephalitis Virus, West Nile Virus, and several tickborne encephalitis viruses.<P>
<B>Herpesviridae</B> - This is one of the largest and most important family of viruses, causing disease in a variety of species. Conditions include Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR), Feline Viral Rhinotracheitis, Equine Rhinopneumonitis, Canine Herpes Virus, Pseudorabies, Marek's disease in chickens and many more. Herpes viruses also infect humans, including human cytomegalovirus, the Epstein_Barr Virus which causes infectious mononucleosis ("mono"), and chicken pox virus (Varicella-Zoster virus) which also causes shingles. Herpes viruses tend to infect nerve cells, and can remain latent until a stressor causes the virus to "recrudesce", as we find when we get cold sores from the herpes simplex virus.<p>
<B>Orthomyxoviridae</B> - This represents the influenza family of viruses, including Avian, Equine, Caninine, and Swine Influenza. It should be noted that avian influenza can also infect chickens, horses, and swine. It is interesting that Infectious Salmon Anemia is also in this family of viruses.<p>
<B>Paramyxoviridae</B> - These viruses include several respiratory pathogens, including Bovine Parainfluenza, Canine Distemper and Parainlfuenza, Measles (Morbillivirus), and Boving Respiratory Syncytial Virus.<p> 
<B>Poxviridae</B> - This includes the pox viruses (but not chicken pox in people). It includes Cow Pox and the Vaccinia virus from which the word vaccine is derived. Pox viruses infect many species.<p>
<B>Retroviridae</B> - This includes the "HIV-like" viruses which infect most domestic species. They include immunodeficiency viruses (BIV, FIV) and leukemia viruses (BLV, FelV). Also in this group is equine infectious anemia for which the coggins test was developed. The retroviridae are unique in possessing a RNA dependent DNA polymerase (reverse trascriptase) which causes insertion of viral DNA (pro-virus) into the host gennome.<p>
<B>Rhabdoviridae</B> - This group includes rabies (affecting all mammals) and vesicular stomatitis in pigs.<p>
<B>Togaviridae</B> - BVD used to be in this group, but has been reclassified in the flaviviruses. Currently the group includes the major Equine Encephaailtis viruses (Eastern, Western, and Venezuelan). Like several flaviviruses, the equine encephalitis viruses are spread by mosquitoes and can potentially infect people.<p>
<center><B>NON-ENVELOPED VIRUSES</B></CENTER><P>
<B>Adenoviridae</B> - These viruses tend to cause hepatitis in a variety of species (including cattle, dogs and horses and several other domestic animals.<P>
<B>Papilloma Viruses</B> - This group includes the wart producing viruses in cattle and horses.<P>
<B>Reoviridae</B> - This group includes serious diseases such as African Horse Sickness, Bluetongue in ruminants, epizootic hemorrhagic disease in cattle, cervids and sheep. Rotaviruses, which infect newborns in several species, are in this group. <P>
<B>Caliciviridae</B> - Caliciviruses are important as cat respiratory pathogen for which we vaccinate.<p>
<B>Parvoviridae</B> - Parvoviruses cause serious gastroenteritis in puppies, and panleukopenia in cats.<p>
<B>Picornaviridae</B> - Rhinoviruses comprise a major group of this group, that includes the common cold. But the group also includes foot-and-mouth disease, bovine enterovirus, swine vesicular disease, encephalomyelocarditis virus (attacking brain, spinal cord and heart)! and the polio virus. Makes me wonder about the common-cold...
