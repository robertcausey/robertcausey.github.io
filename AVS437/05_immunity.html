<h1>05_Immunity</h1>
<h2>Introduction - Humoral and Cellular immunity</h2>
As you are probably aware, when we get sick from a virus like flu or Covid, in most cases we develop an effective response to the virus and rid ourselves of the infection. When we are exposed to the virus a second time our response to the virus is more rapid and more effective. If we show symptoms they are much milder than before, or we may not even get sick. We refer to this strengthening of our defenses against infection as acquired immunity.  The defenses that we put into action have three essential features.<p> 
First we develop defenses against agents that are encountered at body surfaces or in our blood or tissue fluids, but not within cells. Defense against these infectious agents is commonly achieved through free floating antibodies (proteins) in our blood. The antibodies are able to bind to the pathogen and in so doing unleash a series of events targeted directly at the pathogen. These could include neutralizing the pathogen by coating it with antibody so it can't attach to cells, and perhaps can be easily expelled in mucous secretions; it could include activation of a system (the complement cascade) that creates pores in the bacterial cell membrane that cause lysis and death of the bacteria ; if the bacterial cell is resistant to lysis, the complement cascade may instead deposit complexes on the bacteria that make it more easily engulfed by neutrophils or macrophages (like ketchup on a hot dog). This coating is called opsonization after the greek word opsonin meaning "to prepare a meal for." Because these antibodies are free floating in the blood, if we spin the cells down, the cell-free liquid plasma still contains these antibodies. We call this arm of the immune system "humoral" immunity because it can be mediated through body fluid alone, i.e. through the action of cell free plasma. (The humors were orignally believed to be the four chief body fluids, blood, phlegm, yellow bile, black bile). Antibodies are synthesized by plasma cells, which are the final stage of development of B lymphocytes. <p>        
Second, in contrast to pathogens which are "free floating", we need to address pathogens which are located within cells, such as viruses and intracellular bacteria. Antibodies are of limited use if the virus is within a cell. In addition, the virus may hijack the cell's machinery to produce new virus particles.  The body's approach is to first recognize the cell is infected and then cause the cell to undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis). Because infected cells usually have viral proteins on their cell surface, they can be recognized as foreign through binding to antibody-like receptors that are attached to certain host cells. Programmed cell death then kills the viruses trapped inside the cell. This process of recognition and induction of aproptosis is carried out by T cytotoxic cells.  This arm of the immune system we call "cellular immunity" because it is performed by cells directly. <p> 
Third, the body needs to be able to produce enough antibodies to create a suitable immune response, whether it be humoral of cellular. It has been estimated that the body has about 30,000 genes (which is not much). The body needs to produce enough antibodies to recognize any foreign material (antigen) that is encountered. If our genome had to code for enough antibodies to cover all the possible antigens, it would swamp our genetic capacity. Instead, lymphocytes are able to splice and shuffle genes involved in antibody production to increase their range of detection. By analogy, with only 52 cards from a deck of cards, if I am dealt a hand of seven cards, the total number of possible hands I might get is 52 X 51 X 50 X 49 X 48 X 47 X 46 = 674,274,182,400 different hands i.e. 674 X 10<sup>10</sup>. In roughly the same way, by recombining the gene segments which create antibodies, we are able to produce an <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26860/>almost infinite number</A> of combinations such that any antigen could be bound by an antibody. It has been estimated that the antibody genes could produce a <A HREF=https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/decoding-variety-human-antibodies#:~:text=At%20a%20Glance,diagnoses%2C%20and%20design%20personalized%20vaccines.>quintillion (10 X 10<sup>16</sup>)</A>different antibodies.
