<h1>05_Immunity</h1>
<h2>Introduction - Humoral and Cellular immunity</h2>
As you are probably aware, when we get sick from a virus like flu or Covid, in most cases we develop an effective response to the virus and rid ourselves of the infection. When we are exposed to the virus a second time our response to the virus is more rapid and more effective. If we show symptoms they are much milder than before, or we may not even get sick. We refer to this strengthening of our defenses against infection as acquired immunity.  The defenses that we put into action have three essential features.<p> First we develop defenses against agents that are encountered at body surfaces or in our blood or tissue fluids, but not within cells. Defense against these infectious agents is commonly achieved through free floating antibodies 
(proteins) in our blood. The antibodies are able to bind to the pathogen and in so doing unleash a series of events targeted directly at the pathogen. These could include neutralizing the pathogen by coating it with antibody so it can't attach to cells, and perhaps can be easily expelled in mucous secretions; it could include activation of a system (the complement cascade) that creates pores in the bacterial cell membrane that cause lysis and death of the bacteria ; if the bacterial cell is resistant to lysis, the complement cascade may instead deposit complexes on the bacteria that make it more easily engulfed by neutrophils or macrophages (like ketchup on a hot dog). This coating is called opsonization after the greek word opsonin meaning "to prepare a meal for." Because these antibodies are free floating in the blood, if we spin the cells down, the cell-free liquid plasma still contains these antibodies. We call this arm of the immune system "humoral" immunity because it can be mediated through body fluid alone, i.e. through the action of cell free plasma. (The humors were orignally believed to be the four chief body fluids, blood, phlegm, yellow bile, black bile).<p>        
Second, in contrast to pathogens which are "free floating", we have to be able to address pathogens which are located within cells. The classic examples would be viruses, or intracellular bacteria like anaplasma. Antibodies against the flu virus are of limited use if the flu virus is already within a cell. At this point the virus has hijacked the cell's machinery and is cranking out new virus particles undisturbed, and will soon release them  unless...
....unless we can kill the infected cell, and disrupt viral replication without releasing any virus. The way to do this is to first recognize the cell is infected. Fortunately, because infected cells will have altered proteins on their cell surface due to a virus (or a tumor), infected cells can be recognized.
