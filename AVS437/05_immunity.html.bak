<h1>05_Immunity</h1>
<h2>Introduction - Humoral and Cellular immunity</h2>
As you are probably aware, when we get sick from a virus like flu or Covid, in most cases we develop an effective response to the virus and rid ourselves of the infection. When we are exposed to the virus a second time our response to the virus is more rapid and more effective. If we show symptoms they are much milder than before, or we may not even get sick. We refer to this strengthening of our defenses against infection as acquired immunity.  The defenses that we put into action have three essential features.<p> 
First we develop defenses against agents that are encountered at body surfaces or in our blood or tissue fluids, but not within cells. Defense against these infectious agents is commonly achieved through free floating antibodies (proteins) in our blood. The antibodies are able to bind to the pathogen and in so doing unleash a series of events targeted directly at the pathogen. These could include neutralizing the pathogen by coating it with antibody so it can't attach to cells, and perhaps can be easily expelled in mucous secretions; it could include activation of a system (the complement cascade) that creates pores in the bacterial cell membrane that cause lysis and death of the bacteria ; if the bacterial cell is resistant to lysis, the complement cascade may instead deposit complexes on the bacteria that make it more easily engulfed by neutrophils or macrophages (like ketchup on a hot dog). This coating is called opsonization after the greek word opsonin meaning "to prepare a meal for." Because these antibodies are free floating in the blood, if we spin the cells down, the cell-free liquid plasma still contains these antibodies. We call this arm of the immune system "humoral" immunity because it can be mediated through body fluid alone, i.e. through the action of cell free plasma. (The humors were orignally believed to be the four chief body fluids, blood, phlegm, yellow bile, black bile). Antibodies are synthesized by plasma cells, which are the final stage of development of B lymphocytes. <p>        
Second, in contrast to pathogens which are "free floating", we need to address pathogens which are located within cells, such as viruses and intracellular bacteria. Antibodies are of limited use if the virus is within a cell. In addition, the virus may hijack the cell's machinery to produce new virus particles.  The body's approach is to first recognize the cell is infected and then cause the cell to undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis). Because infected cells usually have viral proteins on their cell surface, they can be recognized as foreign through binding to antibody-like receptors that are attached to certain host cells. Programmed cell death then kills the viruses trapped inside the cell. This process of recognition and induction of aproptosis is carried out by T cytotoxic cells.  This arm of the immune system we call "cellular immunity" because it is performed by cells directly. <p> 
Third, the body needs to be able to produce enough antibodies to create a suitable immune response, whether it be humoral of cellular. It has been estimated that the body has about 30,000 genes (which is not much). The body needs to produce enough antibodies to recognize any foreign material (antigen) that is encountered. If our genome had to code for enough antibodies to cover all the possible antigens, it would swamp our genetic capacity. Instead, lymphocytes are able to splice and shuffle genes involved in antibody production to increase their range of detection. By analogy, with only 52 cards from a deck of cards, if I am dealt a hand of seven cards, the total number of possible hands I might get is 52 X 51 X 50 X 49 X 48 X 47 X 46 = 674,274,182,400 different hands i.e. 674 X 10<sup>10</sup>. In roughly the same way, by recombining the gene segments which create antibodies, we are able to produce an <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26860/>almost infinite number</A> of combinations such that any antigen could be bound by an antibody. It has been estimated that the antibody genes could produce a <A HREF=https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/decoding-variety-human-antibodies#:~:text=At%20a%20Glance,diagnoses%2C%20and%20design%20personalized%20vaccines.>quintillion (10 X 10<sup>16</sup>)</A>different antibodies.      

<h2>Antibody production</h2>
Antibodies are produced by B lymphocytes. A given B lymphocyte can only produce one species of antibody molecule. In order for us to produce billions of different species of antibody molecules to detect pathogens we need to produce billions of genetically different B lymphocytes. A key aspect of antibody production, therefore, is to rearrange the DNA (i.e. shuffle it), and then mutate it, to create genetically different B cells. If stimulated appropriately by an antiogen, a particluar B cell may then replicate and make several copies of itself (clones), all of which produce one type of antibody (called a <A HREF=https://about-cancer.cancerresearchuk.org/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/36_Diagram%20showing%20a%20monoclonal%20antibody%20attached%20to%20a%20cancer%20cell%20KF.svg>monoclonal antibody</A>), which is highly specific in what it will bind to. When we say below that regions of antibody molecules vary we mean that they vary between different clonal populations. <p>   
The <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_light_chain#/media/File:AntibodyChains.svg>antibody</A> is divided into an Fab region (antigen binding fraction) and an Fc region (crystaliizable fraction). The Fab region is highly variable allowing it to bind to a variety of pathogens. The Fc region is non-variable i.e. constant, so it can consistently interact with the host cell or other host molecules. The Fab and Fc regions are <A HREF=https://www.rapidnovor.com/structure-and-function-of-antibodies/#postsectionfour>joined by a flexible hinge</A>, which makes it easier to bind to targets in the correct orientation (like adjusting your wrist angle to put a wrench onto a hexagonal bolt).<P>
Each antibody is made of 4 chains, two identical long a.k.a "heavy" chains, and two identical short a.k.a "light" chains. The chains are cross linked to each other using disulfide bonds.<p>
The heavy chain is coded by a single DNA region on a single chromosome. The <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_light_chain>light chain</A> is coded by two alternative genes on two different chromosomes giving rise to either a kappa light chain or a lamda light chain. The ratio of kappa to lamda light chains is about 2:1. The choice of whether to have a kappa or a lamda chain thus introduces some variability.<p>
Within the Fab region closest to the hinge, both light and heavy chains are constant across all different species of antibody. In the region further from the hinge both light and heavy chains are variable. The variable region is the <A HREF=https://cdn.britannica.com/92/20892-050-1F411178/chains-structure-antibody-immunoglobulin-molecule-light-unit.jpg?w=400&h=300&c=crop>antigen binding site</A> and will bind to the infectious agent.<p>
The constant region of the antibody chain is coded by a <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26884/figure/A4471/?report=objectonly>single gene</A> that does not rearrange or mutate and is therefore constant across all antibodies.<P> 
Variability in the light chain arises from <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26860/figure/A4480/?report=objectonly>splicing together</A> any of one of 40 V-segments with any one of the 5 J segments gives 200 possible combinations for the kappa chain, we can estimate 116 combinations for the lamda chain, based on the kappa to lamda ratio. Combined this give 316 possible light chain combinations. <p>
Variability in the <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26860/figure/A4481/?report=objectonly>heavy chain </A>arises from splicing 51 V segments with 27 D segments and 6 J segments which yields 51 X 27 X 6 = 8262 possible combinations. When combined with the light chain we get 316 X 8262 = 2,610,792 possible combinations.<P>
During the joining process conserved DNA in the flanking sequences (introns) undergoes site specific combination during the V(D)J joining process through the action of V(D)J recombinase, which are coded in the rag-1 and rag-2 genes (<em>rag</em> = recombination activating genes). The RAG proteins introduce double stranded breaks and then rejoin using RAG proteins and DNA double strand repair enzymes. Typically, site specific recombination would be very precise, but under the influence of the RAG proteins, a variable number of nucleotides are often lost from the ends of the recombining gene segments, and one or more randomly chosen nucleotides may also be inserted. This increases the diversity by several orders of magnitude, but two out of three arrangements are unproductive, failing to create a functional antibidy molecule, and subsequently undergoe apoptosis. <P>
Of the third of B cells that remain, some will be self-reactive, i.e. their B-cell receptor will bind to self antigens in the bone marrow. These self-reactive B-cells will undergo a second round of V(D)J arrangements and will synthesize antibodies with different specificity, a process known as receptor editing. Of these, any  B-cell clones creating antibody against host proteins will be deleted, creating <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26921/figure/A4440/?report=objectonly>immunological tolerance</A> to self-antigens. <p>
The B cells are ready to leave the bone marrow and <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26921/figure/A4442/?report=objectonly>migrate via the blood vessels</A> to the peripheral lymphoid organs, i.e. <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26921/figure/A4444/?report=objectonly>lymph nodes</A>, spleen, tonsils, and mucosal surfaces, where they are induced by chemical signals to cross postcapillary venules (a process known as chemotaxis). Meanwhile, <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_cell>dendritic cells</A>, located in areas that infectious agents may be encountered, when activated by foreign antigens that they take-up, are carried by lymphatic vessels (affterent lumph vessels) to lymphnodes where they will present these antigens to the B cells, causing them to be activated.  During activation they will undergo additional somatic hypermutations of their DNA. Only a small minority of the altered antigen receptors generated by hypermutation have an increased affinity for the antigen. The few B cells expressing these higher-affinity receptors, however, are preferentially stimulated by the antigen to survive and proliferate, whereas most other B cells die by apoptosis. Thus, as a result of repeated cycles of somatic hypermutation, followed by antigen-driven proliferation of selected clones of memory B cells, <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26860/figure/A4484/?report=objectonly>antibodies of increasingly higher affinity</A> become abundant during an immune response, providing progressively better protection against the pathogen.<p> 
In spite of the huge diversity of the B cell antibody repertoire, it is essential that a given clone of B cells express only one antibody without variation (i.e. the clone is antibody mono-specific). This property enables antibodies to <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26884/figure/A4451/?report=objectonly>cross-link antigens into large aggregates</A>, thereby promoting antigen elimination. It also means that an activated B cell secretes antibodies with the same specificity as that of the membrane-bound antibody on the B cell that was originally stimulated. However, a given B cell, being diploid could produce 6 different antibodies due to maternal and paternal chromosomes using the two heavy chains, and the four light chains, (2 kappa and 2 lamda). Through allelic suppression it only expresses one allele of each gene (maternal or paternal), thus producing only one antibody molecule out of the <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26860/figure/A4486/?report=objectonly>six possible combinations</A>.<p>
Finally, the antibody must transforma itself from being membrane bound to <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26890/figure/A1375/?report=objectonly>being released into solution</A>. In addition, it will need to switch the Immunoglobulin class (i.e. IgM, IgD, IgA, IgG, IgE). This is achieved by cutting and rejoining DNA near <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26860/figure/A4489/?report=objectonly>switch sequences</A>, a given sequence coding for each type of antibody.
