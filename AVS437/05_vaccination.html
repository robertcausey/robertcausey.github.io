<h1>05_Vaccination</h1>
<h2>Introduction - </h2>
Vaccination was preceded by the practice of "variolation", the intentional inoculation of an individual with smallpox (<A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox><em>Variola</em> virus</A>) material. Variolation can be traced back to 16th-century China, and was practiced using a lancet or needle to introduce pulverized dried smallpox scabs or pustule fluid into the skin of an individual. This resulted in a milder form of the disease with a much lower fatality rate (2%â€“3%) than natural smallpox infection. Variolation was employed in Europe and America around the time of the American Revolution.<P>
True vaccination refers to the practice of administering killed or attenuated (i.e.weakened) infectious agents, or their components, into the body to induce an immune response against the agent. The practice is said to have begun by the administration of vaccinia virus (cowpox or similar viruses) to protect humans from the more highly pathogenic small pox virus.<p>  
Vaccination was first documented scientifically by Edward Jenner in 1796, who used cow pox lesions on the arm of <A HREF=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/smallpox/sp_vaccination.html>Sarah Nelmes</A> a milk-maid, as a source of material to vaccinate the arm of <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Phipps>James Phipps</A>, a healthy 8 year-old boy. James Phipps subsequently was inoculated more than 20 times with live small pox virus without contracting disease. Later in Phipps's life, Jenner gave to him, along with his wife and two children, a free lease on a cottage. Phipps attended Jenner's funeral on 3 February 1823. While others had been informally vaccinated  <A HREF=https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/medical-critical-thinking-history/white-lie-heart-vaccine-history#:~:text=In%201796%2C%20Sarah%20Nelmes%2C%20a,give%20the%20boy%20smallpox%20twice.>before James Phipps</A>, Jenner was the first to document vaccination against small pox in a scientific way. <p>
It is worth noting that the word <A HREF=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inoculate#English>"inoculation"</A> literally means to "insert an eye" into something. The term originates from gardening, and means "in-grafting" an eye or bud of one plant into another. It is sometimes used to describe vaccination, but its meaning is much broader, such as "inoculating" a broth to grow a bacteria culture.<p>
<h2>Serology</h2>
Detection of antibodies is important to determine if an individual has developed an immune response to either a vaccination or an infection. We measure antibodies by collecting blood, allowing it to clot, spinning down the cells and the clot proteins, and harvesting the <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Et0piHIm8d4aFMJxuUVRfJcaWrpEoj-x/view?usp=sharing> liquid serum on top</A> which contains antibodies. This can then be tested in a variety of formats (e.g. Agar Gel Immuno Diffusion, ELISA, or Lateral Flow methodology) by detecting antigen and antibody binding to each other through precipitating in a gel, or binding to each other on a surface revealed by a color reaction.<P>
For example, here is a diagnostic kit for the detection of antibodies to Lyme's Disease <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5491346/#:~:text=The%20standard%20of%20care%20for,specific%20B%20burgdorferi%20surface%20proteins.>two tier test</A>. In contrast, we may use commercially prepared monoclonal antibodies to detect antigens from a sample such as a nasal swab or blood, to detect the presence of a pathogen. Examples may include over-the-counter COVID tests, with which all of you are probably familiar, or a <A HREF=https://ksvdl.org/resources/news/diagnostic_insights/january2017/canine.html>heartworm test.</A><p>
