<h1>05_Vaccination</h1>
<h2>Introduction - </h2>
<blockquote>
Vaccination was preceded by the practice of "variolation", the intentional inoculation of an individual with smallpox (<A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox><em>Variola</em> virus</A>) material. Variolation can be traced back to 16th-century China, and was practiced using a lancet or needle to introduce pulverized dried smallpox scabs or pustule fluid into the skin of an individual. This resulted in a milder form of the disease with a much lower fatality rate (2%â€“3%) than natural smallpox infection. Variolation was employed in Europe and America around the time of the American Revolution.<P>
True vaccination refers to the practice of administering killed or attenuated (i.e.weakened) infectious agents, or their components, into the body to induce an immune response against the agent. The practice is said to have begun by the administration of vaccinia virus (cowpox or similar viruses "vacca" is latin for cow.) to protect humans from the more highly pathogenic small pox virus.<p>  
Vaccination was first documented scientifically by Edward Jenner in 1796, who used cow pox lesions on the arm of <A HREF=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/smallpox/sp_vaccination.html>Sarah Nelmes</A> a milk-maid, as a source of material to vaccinate the arm of <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Phipps>James Phipps</A>, a healthy 8 year-old boy. James Phipps subsequently was inoculated more than 20 times with live small pox virus without contracting disease. Later in Phipps's life, Jenner gave to him, along with his wife and two children, a free lease on a cottage. Phipps attended Jenner's funeral on 3 February 1823. While others had been informally vaccinated  <A HREF=https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/medical-critical-thinking-history/white-lie-heart-vaccine-history#:~:text=In%201796%2C%20Sarah%20Nelmes%2C%20a,give%20the%20boy%20smallpox%20twice.>before James Phipps</A>, Jenner was the first to document vaccination against small pox in a scientific way. <p>
It is worth noting that the word <A HREF=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/inoculate#English>"inoculation"</A> literally means to "insert an eye" into something. The term originates from gardening, and means "in-grafting" an eye or bud of one plant into another. It is sometimes used to describe vaccination, but its meaning is much broader, such as "inoculating" a broth to grow a bacteria culture.<p>

<h2>Serology</h2>
<blockquote>
Detection of antibodies is important to determine if an individual has developed an immune response to either a vaccination or an infection. We measure antibodies by collecting blood, allowing it to clot, spinning down the cells and the clot proteins, and harvesting the <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Et0piHIm8d4aFMJxuUVRfJcaWrpEoj-x/view?usp=sharing> liquid serum on top</A> which contains antibodies. This can then be tested in a variety of formats (e.g. Agar Gel Immuno Diffusion, ELISA, or Lateral Flow methodology) by detecting antigen and antibody binding to each other through precipitating in a gel, or binding to each other on a surface revealed by a color reaction.<P>
For example, here is a diagnostic kit for the detection of antibodies to Lyme's Disease <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5491346/#:~:text=The%20standard%20of%20care%20for,specific%20B%20burgdorferi%20surface%20proteins.>two tier test</A>. In contrast, we may use commercially prepared monoclonal antibodies to detect antigens from a sample such as a nasal swab or blood, to detect the presence of a pathogen. Examples of such antigen tests include <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WKnrxkk43ihPrrsmGpL-k3l8sn22BlDr/view?usp=sharing>over-the-counter COVID tests</A>, with which all of you are probably familiar, or a <A HREF=https://ksvdl.org/resources/news/diagnostic_insights/january2017/canine.html>heartworm test.</A>. It is important to know when you take a sample from a patient if the test detects antibody (i.e. serology) or antigen (i.e. detects proteins of the infectious agent).<p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Active versus passive immunization</h2>
<blockquote>
There are two ways to induce immunity. Vaccination involves <em><b>active</b></em> immunization, creating an anamnestic (i.e. memory) response that mimics the response to natural infection. It includes activation of T and B lymphocytes, antigen presentation in the lymph node, and induction of a T<sub>H</sub>1 and/or a T<sub>H</sub>2 response, .<p>
In contrast <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7150278/><em><b>passive</b></em> immunization</A> involves administration of antibodies that provide immediate protection. For example, hyperimmune serum of horses against the causative agent of <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7150278/#:~:text=Whereas%20active%20immunity%20refers%20to,to%203%20or%204%20months.>Diphtheria</A> were highly effective in protecting infected individuals.<p>
As you probably know from your other classes, colostrum is an essential means of providing antibodies in the "first milk" to protect new born farm animals, like foals, lambs, calves, and piglets. Interestingly, there has been research to promote <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10613682/>passive immunization against COVID</A> and other diseases using hyperimmunized bovine colostrum (HBC). <P>
In horses, inadequate ingestion of colostrum leads to failure of passive transfer of maternal antibodies (FPT), resulting in foal septicemia (pneumonia, joint infections, diarrhea, etc). In addition, botulism antitoxin is <A HREF=https://ceh.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/health-topics/botulism#:~:text=Another%20form%20of%20the%20disease,paralysis%20and%20reduced%20muscle%20strength.>frequently delivered to foals</A> to prevent (or treat) botulism due to the toxin secreted by <em>Clostridium botulinum</em>.<P> 
The use of <A HREF=https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/clinical-trials-monoclonal-antibodies-prevent-covid-19-now-enrolling>monoclonal antibodies</A> as a treatment against COVID is a modern example of passive immunization. This approach was reported <A HREF=https://youtu.be/yVqsLjAkcuY>in the news</A> as part of the treatment regimen for President Trump when he contracted COVID in 2020.

<h2>Immune response to Vaccination</h2>
<blockquote>
As we discussed in the previous lectures on T and B cell activation, an essential part of the immune response is to create an anamnestic (memory) response to various pathogens. As we can see from subsequent vaccinations, repetitive stimulation of the immune system creates a more sustained and vigorous response due to the <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-yhz9xpBPmXRjT9OpAMnMxZ_DNu0-27r/view?usp=sharing>anamnestic response and boosting</A><p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Routes of administration</h2>
<blockquote>
<b><em>Parenteral -</em></b> Vaccines are most commonly given by the <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1118997/>parenteral route</A>, (i.e. delivered <A HREF=https://www.etymonline.com/word/parenteral#:~:text=parenteral%20(adj.),intestine%22%20(see%20enteric).>outside the intestine</A>) involving a particular <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NSTF5j5H_8LfWxE8AMPz373UqAQ9LNsP/view?usp=sharing>injection angle</A> depending on whether the injection is subcutaneous, intramuscular, <A HREF=https://www.upmc.com/media/news/010120-bcg-iv-vaccine>intravenous</A> (very rare due to safety concerns), or <A HREF=https://youtu.be/whkGs0dug1s>intradermal</A> for pox viruses.  <p>
<b><em>Mucosal - </em></b>To achieve <A HREF=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-021-00583-2>mucosal immunity (IgA response)</A> vaccines such as some <A HREF=https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/faq/>polio</A>, <A HREF=https://www.flumistquadrivalenthcp.com/administration.html>influenza</A>, or diarrheal diseases may be delivered <A HREF=httpb://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4896761/>mucosally (oral or respiratory)</A><p> 
<b><em>Transcutaneous - </em></b>Interestingly, <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4133827/>trans cutaneous</A> vaccines are also being developed, using delivery devices such as a <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p0JMGg7coV9Cd8Yx5Gt9COTwCCoHlnng/view?usp=sharing>patch</A> instead of a needle.<p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Vaccine additives and immunostimulants</h2>
<blockquote>
Vaccines carry a <A HREF=https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/common-ingredients-fda-approved-vaccines#:~:text=An%20adjuvant%20is%20a%20substance,)%2C%20or%20mixed%20aluminum%20salts.>variety of additives</A> to stabilize the preparation. Of these,  <A HREF=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/adjuvants.html#:~:text=An%20adjuvant%20is%20an%20ingredient,adjuvants%20help%20vaccines%20work%20better.>adjuvants</A> are included specifically to promote the immune response. One of the first adjuvants developed is <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freund%27s_adjuvant>Freund's adjuvant</A>, in which the cell wall of <em>mycobacteria</em> enhance cell mediated immune responses. <p>
As non-vaccine immunostimulants of cellular immunity in horses, cell walls of <A HREF=http://www.novavive.ca/assets/files/WHITE%20PAPER%20-%20MCWF%2018.01.pdf><em>Mycobacterium phlei</em> </A>and killed whole cells of <A HREF=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0737080615300629><em>Propionibacterium  acnes</em></A> are available. <p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Composition of vaccines</h2>
<blockquote>
<b><em>Attenuated strains - </em> </b>Disease causing bacteria and viruses can be weakened so they lose the ability to cause disease, but retain enough foreign antigens that they can be used as vaccines. This process, known as attenuation, can be caused by repeated passage of viruses or bacteria on artificial media. The weakened strains stimulate a protective immune response while causing no disease or only mild disease in the individual receiving the vaccine.  <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4693226/>Attenuated bacterial pathogens</A> can also be used as vectors (delivery systems) to express antigens of other pathogens or to induce an immune response against cancerous cells. <A HREF=https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/9/2/162>Attenuated salmonella vectors</A>  may be used for this purpose.<p>
<b><em>Whole cell vaccines - </em></b>These are among the earliest type of vaccine, in which entire cells of a bacteria, possibly dead or alive, may be used as the vaccine. While these vaccines can be highly immunogenic, they can have unfortunate side effects due to the large array of antigens presented. <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole-cell_vaccine>Whole cell vaccines</A> include <em>Bordetella pertussis</em> (whooping cough) in children and Pneumococcus (<em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>) in the elderly.<p>
<b><em>Modified live virus - </em></b><A HREF=https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=919619def4e17474&sxsrf=ACQVn0_a8In3TuJCo9HqhFgCdlseqNs_2Q:1709218882689&q=modified+live+virus+vaccine&tbm=isch&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjd-OHC6NCEAxUzKlkFHWTmAWAQ0pQJegQIDBAB&biw=1212&bih=597&dpr=2>Modified live virus</A> vaccines are very common in veterinary medicine, and, as their name suggests, are targeted against viruses. They may be multi-valent (i.e. against several pathogens) and are commonly used against respiratory infections. Preparations may include modified live and killed virus in the same preparation. It is generally advised not to give modified-live viruses to pregnant animals owing to the ability of viruses to cross the placenta and infect the fetus. It is generally assumed that they induce a stronger immune response than killed vaccines. <p>
<b><em>Killed vaccines - </em></b><A HREF=https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=919619def4e17474&sxsrf=ACQVn0-ulITyz8N7b-VBgfI6Ronohe9Bgg:1709219284705&q=bacterin&tbm=isch&source=lnms&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=2ahUKEwjE_bqC6tCEAxXzEGIAHdPfDcgQ0pQJegQIChAB&biw=1212&bih=597&dpr=1>Killed Vaccines</A> are very common in veterinary medicine. They are mostly whole cell bacterial vaccines (bacterins) against diseases such as Lyme disease <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em>, pink eye (<em>Moraxella bovis</em>), etc. but can include some virus vaccines. <p>
<b><em> Comparison of live versus killed - </em></b><A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tPCVIlHAn877ZIrixlj1BFPA4Ina_cWa/view?usp=sharing>Live and  killed</A> vaccines have a variety of strengths and weaknesses. In general live vaccines are more immunogenic, but harder to store, whereas killed vaccines are less immunogenic, but more easily stored and transported.<p>
<b><em>Subunit vaccines - </em></b>Subunit vaccines consist of a single antigen on bacteria or viruses to invoke a targeted immmune response, with fewer side effects than whole cell vaccines. Targets include the <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZS6mfiEVuZs8_oJUJlzFGId1vYy7BF7r/view?usp=sharing>pilus antigen</A> of enterotoxigenic <em>Escherichia coli</em>, the <A HREF=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-1118-7>hemagglutinin antigen of influenza</A>, and various antigens on  <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aD9EAjzMv-x28gV7hwmppkxcYys27jGt/view?usp=sharing>COVID-19</A>.<p>
<b><em>Toxoid vaccines - </em></b>Toxoid vaccines are a class of subunit vaccines. They are distinguished by their role of inactivating a specific toxin produced by the infectious organism. They have no effect in eliminating the pathogenic organism itself. Examples include vaccines against the <A HREF=https://cdn.pfizer.com/pfizercom/2022-03/5-Toxid-vaccines-01_1140X675_0.jpg?VersionId=cgOkMYYSc5HdipWSBz24.ZiiIU0WhY.M>tetanus toxin</A>, secreted by <em>Clostridium tetani</em> or the <A HREF=https://aaep.org/guidelines/vaccination-guidelines/risk-based-vaccination-guidelines/botulism>botulism toxin</A> secreted by <em>Clostridium botulinum</em>.<p>
<b><em>Mucosal vaccines - </em></b>As mentioned above there are several <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uotBpZwYad57QlUfAdU1Fyz4NB081zfA/view?usp=sharing>mucosal vaccines</A> in use or in development. One example is the use of <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wm3OKYjD9k1WNw2gjrOkmyN5AcJL2EBE/view?usp=drive_link>salmonella vector vaccines</A> to vaccinate against salmonellosis and other pathogens whose antigens are engineered into the salmonella vector genome.<p>
<b><em>DNA vaccines - </em></b>DNA vaccines involve delivery of a fragment of pathogen DNA that codes for a particular antigen, and then having the antigen expressed by the host cells through the usual process of mRNA transcription and translation. Presentation of the antigen to lymphocytes triggers the immune reaction. <A HREF=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Making_of_a_DNA_vaccine.jpg>DNA vaccines</A> appear to be safe and effective.<p>
<b><em>RNA vaccines- </em></b>RNA vaccines deliver mRNA to be translated directly. Interestingly, some viruses have self-replicating RNA and this can be used to amplify the message. In addition, <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bOSCBlohh1K8hBB_Mbnk0HWULVbuGjIu/view?usp=sharing>RNA vaccines</A> may be designed to induce both antibody and cell mediated immunity via presentation of the whole antigen to induce antibody production, and through presentation of antigenic peptides in the context of MHC-II to induce memory. The <A HREF=https://labeling.pfizer.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=19542>Pfizer vaccine for COVID</A> is an example of an RNA vacccine.<p>
<b><em>Diva vaccines - </em></b>In veterinary medicine, one of the problems we face is to distinguish an antibody response due to infection versus vaccination. The purpose of <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/11GeKbupm2qu1DBvq3-mzCTHTjKTdhE9G/view?usp=sharing>Diva vaccines</A> is to distinguish between the antibody response to vaccination versus the response to infection. Because we identify carriers of disease by having antibodies we may falsely assume an animal is a carrier when it merely has been vaccinated. Conversely, we may assume an animal has been vaccinated when it is in fact a carrier. Diva vaccines allow us to distinguish the antibody response between carriers and vaccinated individuals. <p>
