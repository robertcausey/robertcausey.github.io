<h1>04_Antimicrobial and Antiparasitical Drugs</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>As we saw in the previous modules, infectious diseases are caused by  viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Over the past century we have developed medications which target these pathogens. Against bacteria we have had great success, due to the fundamental biochemical differences between them and ourselves. However, our vital eukaryotic cellular machinery is hijacked by viruses, which makes it difficult to find a way to eliminate viruses without eliminating the host cell itself. Similarly, the cellular machinery of fungi and parasites is similar to our own, which means that medications which are effective in killing these pathogens may be toxic to humans. Successful antivirals, antifungals, and anti-parasiticals have therefor been more challenging to develop than antibiotics against bacteria.<p>
We will cover antibiotics first, and then address antivirals, anti fungals, and antiparasiticals.       
<h2>Antivirals</h2>The <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/13ZAZffT5Dj_FAwKaGAKH-Faw9Mdzp3WB/view?usp=drive_link>development of antivirals</A> seems to have been mostly spurred by developing treatments for the Herpes Simplex Virus, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, the Influenza Virus, and most recently COVID-19. Some key drugs are as follows:
<Blockquote>
<A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idoxuridine><h3>Idoxuridine</h3></A>
<Blockquote>
Idoxuridine, and iodinated form of deoxyuridine, which can be incorporated into viral DNA, is able to disrupt syntehesis of viral DNA. It was the first antiviral developed (1962). It is currently used as an <A HREF=https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/idoxuridine-ophthalmic#:~:text=What%20is%20idoxuridine%3F,FHV%2D1)%20in%20cats.>eyedrop for cats</A> to treat herpes virus.
</blockquote>
<A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidarabine><h3>Vidarabine</h3></A>
<blockquote>
Vidarabine is a nucleoside drug which can be incorporated into viral DNA, introducing an arabinose ara-ATP instead of <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deoxyadenosine_triphosphate>dATP</A> into the viral DNA through competitive inhibition of the viral DNA polymerase. It has been used against DNA viruses since 1976, including Herpes and Pox viruses. 
</blockquote>
<A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aciclovir><h3>Acyclovir</h3></A>
<Blockquote>
Acyclovir is a competitive inhibitor of the viral DNA polymerase, by competitively replacing <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aciclovir#/media/File:Guanosine_aciclovir_comparison.svg>dGTP</A>. It is desigend to treat DNA viruses, and has shown efficacy against HSV, chickenpox, shingles, cytomegalovirus, and the Epstein-Barr virus (all of which are herpes viruses). Clinical uses are detailed <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK542180/>here</A>. It was first approved for use in 1981, and is on the WHO list of <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO_Model_List_of_Essential_Medicines>esseential medicines</A>. In 2020, it was the 162nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions.
</blockquote>
<A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zidovudine><h3>Azidothymidine</h3></A>
<blockquote>
Azidothymidine (AZT) or Zidovudine (ZDV), is the first antiretroviral medication, and has been highly selective in <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC386922/pdf/pnas00325-0322.pdf>competitive inhibition</A> of the retroviral RNA dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase). It is used for post exposure prophylaxis especially in protecting the new born in the event the mother has HIV (vertical transmission). It is the first drug of its kind, and has spurred <A HREF=https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/antiretroviral-drug-development>further development of antiretroviral medications</A>. Perhaps not unexpectedly the drug has been used to treat <A HREF=https://www.woodward-vets.co.uk/images/downloads/medication-leaflets/Zidovudine.pdf> Feline Immunodeficiency Virus</A>. The <A HREF=https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/guidelines/hiv-clinical-guidelines-adult-and-adolescent-arv/antiretroviral-therapy-cost-considerations>cost</A> is probably a significant barrier to treating larger animals, such as horses, for <A HREF=https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/equine/eia/equine-infectious-anemia>Equine Infectious Anemia</A>, or cattle with <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3832697/>BIV</A>.
</blockquote>
<A HEF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9313067/><h3>Saquinivir</h3></A>
<blockquote>
Saquinivir is the first protease inhibitor for HIV therapy. It specifically inhibits the clevage of the phe-prol (phenylalanine-proline), which connects the <A HREF=https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P04585/entry>Gag and Pol</A> fusion protein. Normally a protease would cleave the link and release these proteins, but Saquinivir competitively inhibits the protease enzyme responsible, preventing cleavage of the protein into separate Gag and Pol proteins.  
</blockquote>
<A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539909/><h3>Oseltamivir</h3></A>
<blockquote>
Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is a <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3347517/#:~:text=Neuraminidase%20is%20an%20exosialidase%20(EC,by%20the%206th%20RNA%20segment.>neuraminidasei</A> inhibitor which inhibits viral entry and release mediated by the viral neuramninidase enzyme of flu viruses. The <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_neuraminidase>neuraminidase</A> helps the virus both enter and leave the cell through cleavage of sialic acid residues. <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemagglutinin_(influenza)>Hemagglutinin</A> also play an important role in binding to the host cell, as evidenced by its ability to clump red blood cells (hemagglutination). The <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6520700/>hemagglutinin and neuramindase</A> proteins are used to characterize various influenza types during an outbreak, such as the H1N1 <A HREF=https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/types.htm#:~:text=Influenza%20A%20viruses%20are%20divided,N1%20through%20N11%2C%20respectively).> the H1N1 variant</A> <p>
Although it is a commonly known drug, it appears that Tamiflu's efficacy is <A HREF=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2805976>open to question</A>. 
</blockquote>
<A HREF=https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/therapies/antivirals-including-antibody-products/remdesivir/><h3>Remdesivir</h3></A>
<blockquote>
There does appear to be some efficacy associated with <A HREF=https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2007764>Remdesivir</A> in treating SARS-CoV-2 for the treatment of COVID-19. As an adenosine nucleoside triphosphate analog, the active metabolite of remdesivir interferes with the action of <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remdesivir>viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase</A> and evades proofreading by viral exoribonuclease (ExoN), causing a decrease in viral RNA production.

<h2><A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6604941/#:~:text=Antimicrobial%20agents%20can%20be%20divided,inhibit%20metabolic%20pathways%20in%20bacteria.>Antibiotics</A></h2>The development of antibiotics proabably began with the discovery, by  <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ehrlich>Paul Ehrlich</A>, who hypothesized that stains that bind microbial cell walls could have a therapeutic effect. The first demonstration was to successfully use <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylene_blue>methylene blue</A> to treat malaria, but use was discontinued because it colored urine, sclera, and <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OHfUkLPgTu_bxldCrirzkFy0k7r_-dxA/view?usp=sharing>nervous tissue</A> blue. Ehrlich wen to onto develop aniline dyes as antimicrobials and developed the first treatment for syphilis using <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsphenamine>Arsphenamine</A> or salvarsan which was injected into the <A HREF=https://artsci.case.edu/dittrick/2013/11/08/of-syphilis-and-salvarsan-the-danger-and-promise-of-cure/#:~:text=dissolved%20%5B1%5D.,and%20gently%E2%80%9D%20%5B2%5D.>buttocks</A>. Arsenicals have been used for many years as treatments for various diseases, including the treatment of adult heartworm using <A HREF=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jvma1951/15/3/15_3_94/_article>Sodium Caparsolate. </A> However, treatment carried a substantial risk of causing <A HREF=https://www.safarivet.com/care-topics/dogs-and-cats/heartworms/immiticide-treatment/#:~:text=Complications%20of%20the%20therapy%20include,skin%20grafts%20in%20severe%20cases.>pulmonary emboli</A> and anaphylactic shock. Consequently, patients were hospitalized for treatment. <p> The following shows the subsequent <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TzxYzvjgFtishnTfZp8GlMwprzTfwp7X/view?usp=sharing>antibiotic development</A> and the development of <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c52YtstMZrL6RzXKxTlRyN7oY4XfE6QI/view?usp=sharing>antibiotic resistance</A> which was never far behind. This is a <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_antibiotics>timeline of when the major antibiotics</A> first became available. This is a table of current <A HREF=https://foamid182692890.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/antibiotic-spectrum-of-activity.jpeg>antibiotic spectra</A> of susceptibility<P>
We can <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6604941/table/microbiol-04-03-482-t01/?report=objectonly>subdivide antibiotics</A> according to the following modes of action: inhibition of synthesis of the cell wall; depolarization of the cell membrane; inhibition of protein synthesis, inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis; and inhibition of metabolic pathways. 
<blockquote>
<h3>Inhibit Cell Wall Synthesis</h3> This group includes the penicillins and cephalosporins. They have a <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactam_antibiotics#:~:text=%CE%B2%2Dlactam%20antibiotics%20(beta%2D,%2C%20monobactams%2C%20carbapenems%20and%20carbacephems.>beta-lactam</A>  ring which prevents synthesis of the cell wall during growth. However, bacteria often develop resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics by synthesizing a beta-lactamase, an enzyme that attacks the beta-lactam ring. To overcome this resistance, beta-lactam antibiotics can be given with beta-lactamase inhibitors such as <A HREF=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30844191/#:~:text=Amoxicillin%20is%20a%20penicillin%20derivative,to%20include%20other%20bacterial%20species.>clavulanic acid</A>. You are probably familiar with the drug <A HREF=https://www.petmd.com/pet-medication-clavamox-dogs-cats>Clavamox</A>. Penicillin itself has a narrow spectrum against Gram positive cocci that are non-beta-lactamase producing, such as <em>streptococci</em>.<p>
<A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551517/#:~:text=Initially%20derived%20from%20the%20fungus,cell%20wall%2C%20the%20bacteria%20die.>Cephalosporins</A>, named for the <em>Cephalorium spp</em> of fungi that produces them, have broad spectrum across gram positives and gram negatives. Over the years we have seen five different generations of cephalosporins developed, each with successively broader spectra. Onlt fifth generation cephalosporins have coverage against <A HREF=https://www.cdc.gov/mrsa/index.html>methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em></A> 
<h3>Depolarize the Cell Membrane </h3>The <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8941995/>polymyxin and lipopeptide</A> classes of antibiotics are membrane-targeting drugs of last resort used to treat infections caused by multi-drug-resistant pathogens. Despite similar structures, these two antibiotic classes have distinct modes of action and clinical uses. <p>The <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557540/#:~:text=Polymyxin%20B%20and%20Polymyxin%20E,Pseudomonas%20aeruginosa%20and%20Acinetobacter%20baumannii.>polymyxins</A> target lipopolysaccharide in the membranes of most Gram-negative species and are often used to treat infections caused by carbapenem-resistant species such as <em>Escherichia coli , Acinetobacter baumannii</em> and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> . <p>By contrast, the <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470407/>lipopeptide daptomycin</A> requires membrane phosphatidylglycerol for activity and is only used to treat infections caused by drug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria such as methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and vancomycin-resistant <em>enterococci</em>. 
<h3>Inhibit Protein Synthesis</h3>The ribosome is the part of the cell which manages protein synthesis. The bacterial ribosome may be divided into the 30S and 50S subunits. These subunits thus serve as targets for antibitoics to disrupt bacterial protein synthesis.<p>
<A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryotic_small_ribosomal_subunit>Binding the 30S subunit</A> are the aminoglycosides and tetracyclines. <P>
<A HREF=https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/infectious-diseases/bacteria-and-antibacterial-drugs/aminoglycosides>The aminoglycosides</A> include neomycin, streptomycin, gentamycin, and amikacin. They are generally given IV or as an ointment, although some (gentamycin and amikacin) have been commonly used as infusions into the mare's uterus or systemically during colic, metritis etc. They have strong efficacy against gram negative organisms. nd several gram positives such as streptocci. Care must be givenn when administering aminoglycosides due to the potential for nephrotoxicity.<P>
<A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK549905/>Tetracyclines</A> include tetracycline, oxytetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline etc. They may be given IV, orally, or occasionally IM. They are the drug of choice for <A HREF=https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/infectious-diseases/bacteria-and-antibacterial-drugs/tigecycline>rickettsial agents</A>, such as Anaplasmosis <em>Anaplasma</em> spp and for Lyme disease <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em>. They are contraindicated in pregnant animals due to the potential for maternal hepatotoxicity (liver toxicity) and interfering with tooth growth in neonates.<p>
<A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prokaryotic_large_ribosomal_subunit#:~:text=50S%2C%20roughly%20equivalent%20to%20the,as%20ribosomal%20RNA%20(rRNA).>Binding the 50S subunit</A> are chloramphenicol and the macrolides.<p>
<A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK555966/#:~:text=Chloramphenicol%20is%20a%20medication%20used,antimicrobials%20that%20inhibits%20protein%20synthesis.>Chloramphenicol</A> was the first synthetic antibiotic produced in bulk. However, it's use has been restricted mostly to ophthalmic and dermatologic uses (i.e. eye drops and ointment) due to it's bone marrow toxicity. Given systemically it causes <A HREF=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2285121/>idiopathic, idiosyncratic aplastic anemia</A> i.e. the blood's red cell production shuts down.<p>
<A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551495/#:~:text=Macrolides%20are%20a%20class%20of,otitis%20media%20in%20pediatric%20patients.>The macrolides</A> are a class of drugs used to manage and treat various bacterial infections. Azithromycin, clarithromycin, and erythromycin are commonly used to treat infections like pneumonia, sinusitis, pharyngitis, and tonsillitis. They are also used in uncomplicated skin infections and otitis media in pediatric patients. They are most commonly given orally. The negative side effects include possible gastric or digestive upset due to a suppression of gut motility. In addition, and more seriously, they can be <A HREF=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/long-qt-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20352518#:~:text=After%20each%20heartbeat%2C%20the%20system,on%20an%20electrocardiogram%20(ECG).>cardiotoxic</A> through prolonging the <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/10nH8EgrsO9nSKcL8Ngwd7ZjRyeQLAR29/view?usp=sharing>QT interval</A> in the cardiac cycle</A>. 
<h3>Inhibit Nucleic Acid Synthesis</h3>The <A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK547840/#:~:text=The%20fluoroquinolones%20are%20indicated%20for,fever%2C%20anthrax%2C%20bacterial%20gastroenteritis%2C>fluoroquinolones</A> are a family of broad spectrum, systemic antibacterial agents that have been used widely as therapy of respiratory and urinary tract infections. Fluoroquinolones are active against a wide range of aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Gram-positive coverage includes penicillinase- and non-penicillinase producing Staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, and Nocardia species. Gram negative coverage includes Neisseria meningitides and gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, and most clinically important Enterobacteriaceae species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Vibrio species. <p>
The fluoroquinolones are indicated for treatment of several bacterial infections, including bacterial bronchitis, pneumonia, sinusitis, urinary tract infections, septicemia and intraabdominal infections, joint and bone infections, soft tissue and skin infections, typhoid fever, anthrax, bacterial gastroenteritis, urethral and gynecological infections, and pelvic inflammatory disease and several other infectious conditions.<p>
 The mode of action of the fluorinated quinolones is to inhibit the <A HREF=https://youtu.be/5hwaDamU-jo>enzymes involved in coiling and uncoiling bacterial DNA</A>. Fluorinated quinolones are able to <A HREF=https://youtu.be/IkKZ_gxAOXI>bind to enzymes</A> that separate strands (Topoisomerase II) and that supercoil DNA strands (Topoisomerase IV)</A>. The result is a failure of replication. A means by which these organisms can develop resistance to fluorquinolones is by mutations in these enzymes to prevent the antibiotic from binding, while allowing the gene to function.  
<h3>Inhibit Metabolic Pathways</h3>
The <A HREF=https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/infectious-diseases/bacteria-and-antibacterial-drugs/sulfonamides>Sulphonamides</A> are synthetic bacteriostatic antibiotics that competitively inhibit conversion of p-aminobenzoic acid to dihydropteroate, which bacteria need for folate synthesis and ultimately purine and DNA synthesis. Humans do not synthesize folate but acquire it in their diet, so their DNA synthesis is less affected. <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfonamide_(medicine)>For several years</A> in the late 1930s, hundreds of manufacturers produced myriad forms of sulfa. This and the lack of testing requirements led to the elixir sulfanilamide disaster in the fall of 1937, during which at least 100 people were poisoned with diethylene glycol. This led to the passage of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in 1938 in the United States. As the first and only effective broad-spectrum antibiotic available in the years before penicillin, heavy use of sulfa drugs continued into the early years of World War II. They are credited with saving the lives of tens of thousands of patients, including Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr. (son of US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt) and Winston Churchill. Sulfa had a central role in preventing wound infections during the war. American soldiers were issued a first-aid kit containing sulfa pills and powder and were told to sprinkle it on any open wound.<p>
<A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513232/>Trimethoprim</A> also inhibits <A HREF=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KnEe9Q3byXk-M1C_pc0ftPOShVewrhIE/view?usp=sharing>folate synthesis</A> by competitively inhibiting dihydroflate reductase. The two (sulphonamides and trimethoprim) provide a combined effect in preventing the bacteria from synthesizing tetrahydrofolae required for bacterial DNA replication.<p>

<A HREF=https://www.merckvetmanual.com/pharmacology/antibacterial-agents/sulfonamides-and-sulfonamide-combinations-use-in-animals>Trimethoprim sulpha</A> is a standard first line antibiotic in <A HREF=https://brandonequine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/common-oral-antibiotics-for-horses.pdf>equine practice</A>.
