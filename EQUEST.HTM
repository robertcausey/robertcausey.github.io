Define teasing. What are the signs of a mare in heat? What are the signs of a mare out of heat?<BR>2. What environmental factor controls reproductive seasonality in the horse? This is mediated through the<IMG SRC=pixelshi.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=10>gland which secretes<IMG SRC=pixelshi.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=10>during darkness.<BR>3. What are the 4 basic reproductive seasons in the mare? Approximately in what months does each occur? In which is the mare ovulating, and in which does she not ovulate?<BR>4. During anestrus most mares presented to a stallion will<IMG SRC=pixelshi.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=10 >, however, some will<IMG SRC=pixelshi.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=10 >, and others will<IMG SRC=pixelshi.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=10 >	.<BR>5. During anestrus, follicles are<IMG SRC=pixelshi.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=10 >	 in size, the cervix is<IMG SRC=pixelshi.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=10 > and the uterus is<IMG SRC=pixelshi.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=10 >. <BR>6.  A mare in transition shows what kind of behavior when approached by a stallion?<BR>7. A foal is born February 1 , 1997. Another foal is born in August 1997. How old will both these foals be on Jan 1, 1998 according to breed registries. Which foal will have the advantage if they compete against each other as 2 year olds? Why?  What implications does this have for when people want to breed their horses? Why are mares commonly put under lights in the winter?<BR>8.   What is the impact of season on semen output and libido in the stallion?<BR>9.   What is the length of the estrous cycle in the mare?<BR>10. What is the length of diestrus? Does it vary?<BR>11. What is the length of estrus? Does it vary?<BR>13. When does the mare ovulate relative to estrus?<BR>14. True or false-A mare only produces follicles during estrus, and never ovulates in diestrus.<BR>15. Are multiple ovulations common in mares? Are twins?<BR>16. How long can sperm cells survive in the mare? How long before ovulation can you breed a mare?<BR>17. How long does the oocyte survive? How long after ovulation can you breed a mare?<BR>18. When does the fertilized egg enter the uterus?<BR>19. When does the equine CL become responsive to prostaglandin?<BR>20. Under the influence of estrogen  a mare's uterus and cervix will become<IMG SRC=pixelshi.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=10 >, but under the influence of progesterone they become<IMG SRC=pixelshi.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=10 >	. This is the (same or different ) as a cow.<BR>21. After entry into the uterus the spherical embryo migrates up and down both horns and the uterine body until day<IMG SRC=pixelshi.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=10 >, the day of fixation. Whether the embryo fixes in the left or right horn is (dependent/independent) of the side of the corpus luteum (like/unlike) the cow. <BR>22. At about day<IMG SRC=pixelshi.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=10 > chorionic girdle cells invade the endometrium. They produce structures called<IMG SRC=pixelshi.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=10 >	, which secrete the hormone<IMG SRC=pixelshi.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=10 >	.<BR>23. After day 36 follicles develop on the ovaries, some of these follicles then<IMG SRC=pixelshi.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=10 >, and form functional <IMG SRC=pixelshi.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=10 >	, which secrete the hormone<IMG SRC=pixelshi.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=10 >	.<BR> 24. What hormone (hormone X) starts to decline after day 80 of pregnancy in the mare? What hormones biochemically similar to X  then  continue to increase throughout pregnancy? What tissue produces this second group of hormones?<BR> 25. Equine pregnancy is also characterized by high levels of the hormone <IMG SRC=pixelshi.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=10 >, (produced by the fetal gonads) which spills into urine after day150. Fetal gonads are largest at about day<IMG SRC=pixelshi.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=10 >, exceeding<IMG SRC=pixelshi.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=10 > in size.<BR>26. What is the average gestation length of a mare? Does gestation length vary in the mare?<BR>27. Milk in the udder indicates foalng in<IMG SRC=pixelshi.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=10 >. Foaling can most accurately be predicted using<IMG SRC=pixelshi.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=10 >	. <BR>28. Define "waxing" relative to impending parturition in the mare.<BR>29. Parturition (rapid /slow) in the mare and occurs mostly at what time of day?<BR>30. The placenta is normally released within<IMG SRC=pixelshi.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=10 >hours of birth. A placenta retained for<IMG SRC=pixelshi.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=10 > is considered a medical emergency.<BR>31. The first post-partum estrus is called<IMG SRC=pixelshi.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=10 >, and occurs about day<IMG SRC=pixelshi.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=10 > in the mare.<BR><IMG SRC=pixelshi.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=10 align=left><IMG SRC=pixelshi.gif WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=10 align=left></BODY></HTML>
