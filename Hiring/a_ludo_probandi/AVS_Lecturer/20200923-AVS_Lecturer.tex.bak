\textbf{How does this position address needs in academic programming (i.e., courses taught)?}\\~\\
\small\sffamily Due to recent faculty retirements, AVS has reduced teaching capacity in the face of continued high enrollment. This shortage of teaching faculty threatens delivery of our heavily enrolled, foundational, first year courses (AVS 145/146). Furthermore, there is a need to strengthen aspects of the AVS curriculum to better prepare our graduates to enter Maine’s agricultural workforce, familiarizing them with new technologies, and positioning them to assume leadership roles in animal agriculture. The AVS faculty feel that a Lecturer should be hired to deliver the foundational classes to first year students, and to strengthen industry-relevant course offerings for students planning to join the workforce in animal agriculture, biotechnology, and related sectors.

The core teaching need met by the Lecturer will be to deliver AVS 145 – Introduction to Animal Science, and AVS 146 - Introduction to Animal Science Laboratory. Both courses are required by AVS Majors, and meet specific requirements for Sustainable Agriculture and Zoology majors. Currently the course has 103 students enrolled. To meet this high demand, and the scheduling needs of diverse students, the lecture course (AVS 145) will be offered in Fall and Spring semesters. The laboratory course (AVS 146) will also be offered in the Fall (4 lab sections) and Spring (1 - 2 lab sections).  The Lecturer will also deliver NFA 117 to the incomng cohort of first year students, take on a significant advising load (approximately 40 students). The Lecturer will transition into serving as undergraduate coordinator for AVS, the largest program in SFA with over 200 majors. In addition the position may assist delivery of experiential classes at the Witter Center in horses (AVS 196, 303, 397), dairy cattle (AVS 347 and 371), and sheep (AVS 232). The individual will also contribute to our capstone sequence (AVS 401 and 402).
