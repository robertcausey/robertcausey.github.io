\textbf{How does this position address needs in academic programming (i.e., courses taught)?}\\~\\
\small\sffamily 
This position request is to replace a vacancy left by the departure of one of our faculty (Angela Myracle). The position teaches coursework to satisfy certification requirements of our Didactic Program in Dietetics by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND), enabling our students to sit for the Certifying Examination to become a Registered Dietitian.
\\~\\
The primary teaching responsibilities of the position include: FSN 410 Human Nutrition and Metabolism, FSN 571 Technical Presentations, plus a graduate class in Science Communications, and a graduate class in nutritional biochemistry to meet curricular needs, including the UMaine Gold Program. The teaching load will average 9 credits a year. Currently we are utilizing adjunct instructors to cover this vacancy during AY 20-21.
\\~\\
Graduate supervision is an important part of this position. Responsibilities will include research, teaching, student advising, and providing expertise to the state and UMaine community in the areas of human nutrition and nutritional biochemistry.\\~\\
\vfill
\noindent\textbf{\rmfamily How does this position support the research mission of the unit?}\\~\\
The position will conduct research in Nutritional Biochemistry/Nutrigenomics, focused on translational  research to improve human health, especially in Maine's population. Applicants are expected to build a robust, externally-funded research program and create collaborations within the School, Cooperative Extension, Graduate School of Biomedical Science and Engineering, and other units across campus, and with other institutions such as Jackson Laboratory, Maine Medical Center Research Institute, the medical community in Maine, local farmers, and food producers. This position has the potential to have a positive impact on the health of Maine's population, and on Maine's food system through many ways, including identifying nutritional benefits of Maine food products. The position carries an expectation for mentoring and advising of graduate students and for supervising undergraduate research.

This position directly supports 4 Initiatives of the College Road-map to Excellence:\\~\\ 
\#1.~Excellence in undergraduate advising.\\ 
\#2.~Growing our research enterprise in the service of science and Maine by building a robust, externally-funded research program in nutritional biochemistry.\\
\#3.~Enhancing quality and impact of our graduate education programs bu addressing that there are too few nutrition faculty members to meet the demand for graduate thesis mentors.\\
\#4.~Rising to meet Maine's health care needs by preparing students to become registered dietitians in a program certified by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics and by improving health of Maine's population through scientific discovery and innovation in the fields of human nutrition and food science.
\\~\\
The position supports the University's strategic values and vision statements by supporting learners in experiential learning and innovation in food and nutrition (Goals 1.1 and 1.2), supports key infrastructure such as the Mary Simcock Lynch Clinical Laboratory (Goal 2); and through using the hire to support diversity, equity and inclusion (Goal 3).
\\~\\
This position directly supports all three of the UMaine System R \& D Goals for FY 20-24:\\~\\
\#1.~Make Maine the best state in the nation to live, work, and learn by 2030, by improving food processing for Maine consumers and Maine food producers. \\
\#2.~Establish an innovation-driven Maine economy for the 21st century by advances in human nutrition, and understanding the nutritional benefits of Maine Food products.\\
\#3.~Prepare the knowledge-and-innovation workforce for Maine by training qualified graduates and undergraduates to enter the Maine health care and public health workforce.\\~\\
