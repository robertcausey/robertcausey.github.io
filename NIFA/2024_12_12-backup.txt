<!-- In 2-3 sentences, briefly describe the issue or problem that your project addresses.-->
A working knowledge of equine anatomy is essential for horse owners and professionals to prevent and manage equine leg injuries. This knowledge is usually acquired by veterinarians through dissection of horse cadavers. However, this approach is not feasible for non-veterinarians due to cost, and infrastructure. In addition, the lack of mobility of fixed or frozen specimens, due to rigor mortis, prevents learners from appreciating joint function, mobility, and weight-bearing capacity. We will address gaps in anatomical knowledge by determining the feasibility of building and testing flexible anatomical models as part of learning modules for horse owners and equine professionals

<p><strong>1. Wine and Equine event history</strong></p>

<p>As back ground, we had held a program for horse owners focusing on equine biomechanics and saddle fitting in the summer of 2023. The&nbsp;presenter was Dr Maren Bohleber, a&nbsp;Professional Equine Physiotherapist practicing in Austria and Germany. At the Zillman Art Gallery in Bangor she presented lecture material regarding equine anatomy and biomechanics. At the J. F. Franklin Witter Center&nbsp; she demonstrated equine anatomy on&nbsp;the live horse, gait analysis, and saddle fitting. The presentation included a mounted demonstration by our equine trainer Cassie Astle.&nbsp; The information from this event helped to shape our work for the current year&nbsp;October 1, 2023 to&nbsp;&nbsp;September 30,&nbsp;2024. The focus of our effort has been in teaching anatomy using a live horse, using a visual blanket and identification of palpatable structures.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2. Construction of a PVC horse Skeleton that sustains its own weight</strong></p>

<p>Following receipt of a UMaine EPIC grant (<em>Stand on your own four feet - now stretch,&nbsp;</em>$10,000) we detailed all the parts necessary for construction of the PVC horse skeleton. The skeleton will stand on it&#39;s own using cord and nylon fishing line to stabilize the joints, representing the muscles, tendons and ligaments&nbsp;under load in a standing horse. This is an ongoing project for students in AVS 397 - Equine Internship, and AVS 401-402, the&nbsp;Capstone class sequence in Animal and Veterinary Sciences. Our initial work has been successful in creating a model of the axial skeleton of the horse, hips, and limbs from earlier models.</p>

<p><strong>3. Equine Physiotherapy Instruction</strong></p>

<p>During the academic year from 2023-2024 we have introduced equine anatomy into our equine laboratory course, based on palpation of bony structures in the live horse. By introducing the material to students we are able to develop, assess, and improve&nbsp;teaching modalities for equine anatomy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>4. Detection of Ground Force Reaction</strong></p>

<p>In the spring of 2024 we were approached by a private company to assist in development of&nbsp;a technology to detect the ground reaction force transmitted through the horse&#39;s hooves when the animal strikes the floor during movement. We successfully installed a prototype in an indoor arena. The detection instrument is below the arena surface, and invisible to the horse. The unit at&nbsp;UMaine&#39;s Witter Center sends data directly to the company in Maryland.&nbsp;The data is in the form of loadbearing cell detection of force in the x, y, and z directions. The unit has been calibrated and initial test runs have shown useful data, and detection of lameness in one horse known to be lame.</p>

<!-- Briefly describe how your target audience benefited from your project’s activities. -->

Many of the target audience for improved understanding of anatomy and biomechanics, physiotherapy etc  are equine owners and equine professionals. Developing new ways to share this information will ultimately help them in managing lameness and performance in their own horses as well as client horses.

The PVC Horse is a novel learning modality designed to improve students and professionals ability to engage with educational materials involving horses. By improving education of students in the pre-veterinary sciences esepcially we hope to increase the number of large animal veterinarians. 

The ground force reaction sensor device will support a small company's efforts to improve lameness detection in the industry. This would lead to improved welfare of horses, reduced injuries, and help generate a better perception of the equine industry.

<!-- Briefly describe how the broader public benefited from your project's activities. -->

The broader public will benefit from a better impression of the equine industry being science based, with improved well-being of horses overall.
