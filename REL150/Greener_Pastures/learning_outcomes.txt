Learning objectives (Greener Pastures)
1. RLE student-investigators will identify areas of animal agriculture about which they feel curious, care about, and have a wish to explore.
2. RLE student-investigators will discuss these areas with their peers.
3. RLE student-investigators will choose a specific area in which to conduct an investigation.
4. RLE student-investigators will compare and contrast possible research questions as the starting point of their investigation.
5. RLE student-investigators will formulate a specific research question to be asked, plan their research according to their academic discipline (science, social science, art), carry out their plan, and share the outcome with their peers.
6. RLE student-investigators appraise the success of their own research, its value to themselves personally, and to others.

Possibly we could include an element of peer review, but perhaps that should be a topic for discussion by RLE faculty before committingÂ to it.
