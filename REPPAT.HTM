Blind mares may or may not detect enough light to cycle. Good lighting should be assessed at the level of the mare's eye.<P><B><LI>Pineal Gland</B><P>The pineal gland is located within the folds of the brain and during short days secretes a hormone called melatonin which suppresses reproductive activity by shutting down GnRH production from the hypothalamus.<P><B><LI>Hypothalamus</B><P>The hypothalamus is part of the brain which secretes a hormone called Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) which causes release of gonadotopins from the pituitary.<P><B><LI>Pituitary</B><P>The pituitary releases the two gonadotropin hormones (FSH and LH) which drive events on the ovary. FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) drives follicular growth on the ovary, LH (luteinizing hormone) causes ovulation and development of the corpus luteum. The pituitary also releases oxytocin which causes milk let-down and uterine contractions.<P><B><LI>Ovary</B><P>The ovary is where the egg (also known as the ovum or oocyte) is produced inside the follicle.<P><B><LI>Follicle</B><P>The follicle is a fluid filled blister on the ovary which carries the egg. The growing follicle secretes the hormone estrogen which makes the mare show heat and prepares the uterus to clean up the contamination of breeding. At ovulation the blister bursts and the egg is released into the oviduct. The lining of the burst follicle thickens and forms a yellow lump known as the corpus luteum (corpus luteum is Latin for "yellow lump").<P><B><LI>Corpus luteum </B><P>The corpus luteum is formed from the thickening of the wall of the ruptured follicle. It secretes progesterone which makes the mare go out of heat, and causes the uterus to provide nourishment and protection for a pregnancy.<P><B><LI>Oviduct</B><P>The oviduct is a long, thin, winding tube between the ovary and uterus where the egg meets the sperm and fertilization takes place. Semen from the stallion may remain viable here for several days after live cover.<P><B><LI>Uterus</B><P>The uterus is the large organ where the foal, surrounded by the placenta, grows through most of gestation. The inner lining of the uterus is called the endometrium, which secretes nutrition for the foal, and may be damaged in mares with "fibrosis". The outer layer is called the myometrium which is the outer layer of muscle which contracts and pushes the foal into the birth canal.<P><B><LI>Cervix</B><P>The cervix is a thick muscular tube which is the gateway to the uterus. It is open during heat, under the influence of estrogen, to allow the stallion to deposit semen, and to allow the excess semen and contamination to drain away. It is closed tight during pregnancy and when the mare is out of heat to protect the developing embryo.<P><B><LI>Vagina</B><P>The vagina is the outer-most cavity of the mare's reproductive tract. It has two compartments, the "true vagina"  close to the cervix, and the outer "vestibule". The two compartments are separated by a sphincter which, if damaged, causes the mare to suck air and contamination into the vagina and perhaps the uterus. The condition is partially corrected by the Caslick's procedure.<P><B><LI>Vulva</B><P>The vulva is the outermost opening of the vagina.  The top portion is sutured closed in the Caslick's procedure.<P><B><LI>Clitoris</B><P>The clitoris is a small remnant of the penis located at the bottom of the vulva. It is enlarged when mares are given male steroids and it harbors the bacterium <I>Taylorella equigenitalis</I> which causes contagious equine metritis (CEM).<P> </OL><B><LI>The Four Reproductive Seasons</B><P> Mares are "long day breeders" and day length drives the mare's reproductive cycle through 4 breeding seasons. The mare only ovulates, and will only become pregnant,  during the true breeding season and will not ovulate or become pregnant during winter anestrus, spring transition or fall transition. The mare's winter coat indicates that she is not cycling, though she may show irregular heat signs.<P><OL type=A><B><LI>Winter anestrus </B><P>The mare is reproductively inactive during the winter months. The mare may show irregular heat during anestrus.<P><B><LI>Spring transition</B><P>The mare will usually show long or irregular heats (perhaps every 3 to 4 days) during March and early April. Transition ends at the first ovulation of the year which occurs usually close to mid-April.  <P><B><LI>Summer - The true breeding season</B><P>The mare regularly cycles with a consistent 15 days out of heat, and about 6 days in heat. Heat is longer (sometimes longer than 7 days) early in the breeding season (April/May), and shorter (sometimes 3 to 4 days) at the peak of the breeding season (June /July). A mare consistently ovulates 24 - 48 hours before going out of heat. The 15 day period of being out of heat is consistent throughout the breeding season.<P><B><LI>Fall transition</B><P>Mares will stop ovulating in the fall. This usually passes unnoticed because people are no longer concerned about breeding their mares in the fall.<P></OL>   <B><LI>The Breeding Season<P></B>The mare's behavior is the only way, short of a veterinary visit, to determine where she is in her reproductive cycle. This requires teasing with a stallion. Successful breeding requires that mares are bred when they are in heat, and timed so that the mare ovulates shortly after breeding. With live breeding, with a healthy mare and stallion and no veterinary examinations, breeding every other day until the mare goes out of heat is an appropriate schedule. Otherwise, the veterinarian by palpation can determine when the mare is about to ovulate and time breeding accordingly. Whenever a mare is bred with shipped or frozen semen a veterinarian should always be used to time the breeding.<P><OL type=A><B><LI>Teasing</B><P>Teasing is bringing a mare and a stallion together to assess the mare's behavior. It is a necessary, usually daily, routine on a breeding farm. Mares vary greatly in their behavior, so it is necessary to learn what each mare displays. Concern should be given to the mare and stallion's safety; a solid, smooth partition, 5 feet high, over which the stallion may nuzzle the mare is suitable. It should be free from sharp edges so that no injuries occur if the stallion tries to cross it or the mare tries to kick or lean against it. The following are the indications of a mare in or out of heat.<P><OL type=1><B><LI>In heat</B><P>The mare stands patiently, perhaps with a dreamy expression in her eyes, as the stallion talks to, nuzzles, or licks her. Her tail is lifted; she lowers her haunches, urinates, her ears are forward. Evertion of the clitoris (the clitoral wink), is a key sign of a mare in heat.<P><B><LI>Out of heat</B><P>The mare is agitated, dances, may kick, bite or strike at the stallion. Her ears are back.<P> <B><LI>Ambiguous signs</B><P>For a variety of reasons a mare may show ambiguous signs, such as at the beginning and end of the cycle. These may include a mare being aggressive at the stallion's approach, then showing heat when he is led away. Some mares may encourage a stallion to approach, but then kick when he nuzzles them. Occasionally mares may show no interest in the stallion but merely stand or eat grass, oblivious to his presence. When mares with foals are teased, the foal should be kept back to prevent injury if the mare kicks. Mares protecting their foals may not show good heat. It is sometimes helpful to twitch or apply a lip chain to mares that routinely fail to show heat.<P></OL><B><LI>The Estrous Cycle</B><P>The mare regularly cycles with a consistent 15 days out of heat, and about 6 days in heat. Heat is longer (sometimes longer than 7 days) early in the breeding season (April/May), and shorter (sometimes 3 to 4 days) at the peak of the breeding season (June /July). A mare consistently ovulates 24 - 48 hours before going out of heat. The 15 day period of being out of heat is consistent throughout the breeding season. <P>The estrous cycle is usually divided into two phases: estrus (in heat) and diestrus (out of heat)<P>.<OL type=1><B><LI>Estrus</B><P>The mare enters estrus with growing follicles on the ovaries, as she begins to show heat. As the mare proceeds through estrus, one follicle becomes dominant and suppresses growth of the other follicles. This follicle over a few days will reach a size of 35 mm or greater in diameter. When the follicle reaches this size or larger the pituitary releases luteinizing hormone, which causes final maturation of the follicle and ovulation. The mare goes out of heat 1-2 days after she ovulates.<P><B><LI>Diestrus</B><P>Following ovulation the follicle becomes a corpus luteum which secretes progesterone. This hormone takes the mare out of heat, and prepares the uterus for the embryo if the mare has been bred. About 12 days after ovulation if the mare is not pregnant the uterus releases a substance known as prostaglandin F 2 alpha (PGF). This substances signals the corpus luteum to terminate itself, and to stop producing progesterone. About 3 days later the mare comes back in heat with a fresh group of follicles growing on the ovary.<P><B><LI>Maternal Recognition of Pregnancy</B><P>When the mare becomes pregnant the embryo prevents the release of PGF. The corpus luteum will therefore persist on the ovary, continuing to secrete progesterone to maintain pregnancy. The pregnant mare will therefore not come back into heat. <P><B><LI>Exceptions</B><P>The estrous cycle of individual mares is unlike this in many ways. A few mares will ovulate two follicles. Twins may occasionally result from these double ovulations. A few mares will ovulate when they are out of heat (in diestrus). This disrupts the cycle, and these mares may remain persistently out of heat unless treated by a veterinarian. Some mares show very weak heats. Others are in heat for very short periods of time, especially at midsummer. Large follicles may sometimes be present on the mare's ovary at any time during the estrous cycle, and they may or may not ovulate. In other words, mares may be very confusing to veterinarians and breeding managers. <P> <B><LI>Foal heat</B><P>The mare is unusual in that about 9 days after she foals she will come into heat (the foal heat). Mare's may be bred on this or subsequent cycles although the merits of breeding on the foal heat are controversial. If the foal heat comes early, say at 6 days, its best to let the mare ovulate and then short cycle her to breed on the next heat. If foal heat comes late, so that she ovulates at about day 15, then breeding on the foal heat may be recommended. Mares that foal in January or February, when other mares are not cycling, have their reproductive systems jump started by the act of foaling, and begin cycling. Some may shut down after a cycle or two if not kept under lights. The stress of lactation may prevent a few mares from cycling altogether (lactational anestrus).<P> </OL></OL> <B><LI>Manipulation of the Cycle</B><P>Veterinarians are able to manipulate the cycle by using drugs which mimic the reproductive hormones of the mare, and by giving artificial light.<P><OL type=A><B><LI>LH</B><P>The action of luteinizing hormone may be mimicked by the drug Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG). This drug causes ovulation approximately 36 hours following administration if the mare is in estrus and a follicle greater than 35 mm is present when the drug is given. This drug is very useful when it is important to time the breeding carefully, as with frozen semen breedings. <P><B><LI>PGF</B><P>Prostaglandin F 2 alpha (Lytalyse) may be given to mares when they are in diestrus. The drug terminates the corpus luteum and brings the mare back into heat ahead of schedule (short cycling). This is frequently useful if a breeding is missed on a mare, and one wants to bring her back into heat without waiting the whole cycle. If the mare is pregnant, one dose before 35 days will terminate pregnancy, so make sure it's given to the right mare.<P><B><LI>Progesterone</B><P>The action of progesterone may be mimicked by the drug Regumate. This oral product is used to synchronize the estrous cycle of mares, suppress heat signs, and to boost the progesterone levels of pregnant mares who sometimes lose pregnancies. It should not be used in mares who tend to get uterine infections.<P><B><LI>GnRH</B><P>Implants which induce cycling or ovulation are becoming increasingly common. These are slow releasing preparations of GnRH -like hormones which are placed under the skin.<P><B><LI>Light</B><P>If you want your mare to be bred earlier than May, you may put her under 16 hours of light a day starting on December 1st. This will have her cycling in February. Adequate light (10 foot candles) may be assessed by taking a camera set for 400 ASA film, aperture set at F4, shutter speed at 1/4, and placing a white styrofoam cup over the lense, holding the camera at the eye level of the mare. The camera's light meter should indicate sufficent or excessive light for exposure at those settings. Usually a 12 X 12 box stall with a 100W incandescent bulb is sufficient.<P>  </OL>    </BODY></HTML>
