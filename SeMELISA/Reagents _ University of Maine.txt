I think you would want to target 5-8.We use Sigma, catalog # H2153.  Protocols for running the HABA assays can be found here.  You will need to run this in the context of the specs for your spectrophotometer.  http://www.piercenet.com/product/haba-reagentThe antibody is already in PBS, here is a list of directives for the biotin conjugation:1.  Adjust the concentration of the antibody to ~ 1.5 mg/ml. 2.  Warm the biotin to room temperature3.  Prepare solution of biotin in DMSO to 40 mg/ml. 4.  Add the biotin ester (which is the biotin in DMSO) to the antibody at a ration of 2 mg biotin / 10 mg of antibody.  This will produce a 64 molar excess of biotin reagent over the protein.  5.  Mix well and incubate at RT for 1 hour6.  Buffer exchange into 0.15M PBS (by dialsys, use appropriate molecular weight cut off)7.  Adjust the final concentration of the antibody to 1 mg/ml with PBSLet me know if you have any questions, good luck!NathalieNathalie Forster, M.S.Hybridoma Development Manager Maine Biotechnology Services, Inc.1037R Forest Ave.Portland, ME 04103207-797-5454 ext.27Fax:207-797-5595nforster@mainebiotechnology.com
