<h1>01_Describing Disease</h1>
<B>Introduction</B>
<blockquote>
Welcome to Animal Diseases. In this first lecture I wish to cover two topics as back ground. The first is to provide a brief introduction into how we describe disease in populations. The second is to review the anatomy of some of the body's barriers to disease, especially infectious disease.

<B>Describing Disease</B>
<blockquote>
Most of us think of disease as something which occurs in an individual animal or individual person. However, diseases should be thought of as something <em>occurring in a population</em>. Not only are some diseases spread between thousands of animals, but thousands of animals may be exposed to a particular toxin or environmental condition which causes illness. The result is that diseases almost always occur in some but not all animals in a population, making it a complicated situation to analyze. <p>
As veterinarians we are interested in how widespread and severe a disease is, so we can make appropriate plans to address an outbreak. To do so we will use terms like Incidence, Prevalence, Morbidity, and Mortality to describe magnitude and severity of disease in a population. But also we wish to assess the possible causes of disease, and to identify what led to a disease outbreak, so we can prevent it. In this case we can talk about Risk Factors, Relative Risk, and Odds Ratios.<p>
<B>Incidence</B><P>
<A HREF=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hus/sources-definitions/incidence.htm#print>Incidence</A> measures the number of <em>new</em> cases of a disease which occur over a specified period of time. It is particularly useful in monitoring outbreaks of an infectious disease.<p> 
<B>Prevalence</B><P>
<A HREF=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/what-is-prevalence#part_2624>Prevalence</A> 
measures how common a particular condition is at a given point in time, location, or particular population. It is useful in measuring chronic conditions or diseases which arise and are maintained by individuals in a population, such as hip-dysplasia in German Shepherds, or hypertension in old people like myself.<P>
<b>Morbidity</b><p>
<A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK547668/>Morbidity</A> is a measure of how many animals show illness, and may be described using incidence or prevalence. An interesting aspect of morbidity is that some animals that test positive or share a predisposition for the disease but may not exhibit any indications of illness (clinical signs).  Similarly, some of you may know someone who tested positive for COVID but showed no indication of illness. If so they would not be counted as "morbid" or sick. We may carry many bacteria or viruses but not all of them, indeed perhaps few of them, cause disease or cause morbidity.<p>
<b>Mortality</b><p>
<A HREF=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK547668/>Mortality</A>, as its name suggests, is a measure of how many individuals die during a disease outbreak relative to the population as a whole, not relative to those who became sick. For those of you who are interested in these statistics you might enjoy perusing the Center for Disease Control's weekly Mortility and Morbidity <A HREF=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/mmwr_additional_resources.html>Report</A><p>  
<b>Relative Risk</b><p>
<A HREF=https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/understanding-relative-risk-odds-ratio-related-terms/>"Risk"</A> is how we indentify the cause of disease. In trying to understand the causes of flu we might say a possible causes of flu (a.k.a. risk factor) could be <em>Standing out in the rain</em>. To see if standing in the rain does indeed contribute to flu we could start by looking at a group of people who stand out in the rain as part of their work and record the incidence of flu over a given time period i.e. the number of new cases in a given period &#247 the total number exposed. This incidence may also be referred to as the Absolute Risk of catching flu in folks who stand out in the rain. <p>
For comparison we could also follow the Absolute Risk for folks who are not exposed to rain by measuring the incidence of flu over the same period of time in <em>folks who work indoors</em>. We could then compare the incidence of flu in those who stood out in the rain (exposed) to the incidence of flu in those who stayed indoors (unexposed). If the incidence of flu in the rain group is higher than the indoor group we can conclude that exposure to rain increases the risk of catching the flu i.e. rain is a risk factor for catching the flu. <p>
When we divide the incidence of the exposed by the unexposed (i.e. incidence of flu in rain &#247 incidence of flu indoors), if the number is &#62; 1, we can say there is a positive relative risk of catching the flu from standing out in the rain. If the number is &#60; 1 we can say that standing outside in the rain reduces the incidence of flu. If the number is 1, we would probably conclude that standing in the rain has no impact of whether you get the flu or not, or that we need to rethink how we appproached the study.<P>
This study would be considered a Prospective Study. In this case we start by knowing the exposure and then we follow each group to collect the cases occur over the course of the study. Because we plan the study and then watch the cases emerge we consider this a watch-what-will-happen kind of experiment. Hence we call it a PRO-spective study in which we follow two cohorts of patients, the "exposed" and the "unexposed", and collect data on them over the course of the study, expecting to see greater numbers of cases in the exposed cohort. This approach is also used in clinical trials to show drug safety and efficacy, however, in this case we would hope to see <em>fewer</em> cases of disease in the exposed cohort, because the exposure was to receive a drug treatment we hope would reduce cases of disease.<p>
<b>Odds and Odds Ratios</b><p>
An alternative way of conducting the study is to imagine you work in the ER at Eastern Maine Medical Center and see folks coming in with the flu. As a young resident clinician you would like to do a small study to test your hunch that people standing out in the rain get flu. A way to approach this is to select patients you have seen with the flu and ask them if they have been out in the rain recently. As a comparison, for each person with the flu, you select one or more control patients who do not have the flu as matches for each case, but are similar to the case in all other respects. You then also ask the controls if they have been out in the rain. <p>
For all the cases and controls who worked in the rain (the exposed group), you compute the odds that they got the flu (exposed cases&#247;exposed controls), and in those who did not stand out in the rain you also compute the odds that they got the flu (unexposed cases&#247;unexposed controls). You then compute the <A HREF=https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/understanding-relative-risk-odds-ratio-related-terms/>Odds Ratio</A>, which is the odds of getting flu if you are in the rain &#247; the odds of getting flu if you are not in the rain. Like relative risk, if the Odds Ratio is &#62; 1 then we can say that standing out side increases the likelihood of getting the flu. If the Odds Ratio is &#60; 1 we can say that standing out in the rain reduces the likelihood of getting the flu.<p>
This type of study, known as a Case-Control study, is considered a retrospective study, because we plan the study to look at exposure that occurred prior to the conducting the study. We already know who has the disease; we are looking back to identify if previous exposure caused it, hence it is a RETRO-spective study.
