	Hello UMaine future veterinarians (i.e. students in the pre-veterinary concentration). I wanted to post information regarding the FEEPASS program at Glasgow University so both you and I (as an advisor) would have easy access to the information. Briefly, you can start the application process to the University of Glasgow in the fall of your 2nd or 3rd year (3rd or 5th semester). For more information you can follow the links below:
