Chose to contact Dennis Ruksznis who came and examined him. 	Large mass off pelvic vertebrae imaged using transrectal ultrasound.		It appears he has metastatic neoplasia with lesions in vertebra, prepuce, and left flank. The disease is slowly progressive. We have tentatively elected to euthanize him on Thursday of next week. 	Continued daily physical examinations.  Hand walking, with redcell and ulcerguard. Will confirm appointment with Dennis for Thursday 19th.

	rcausey@maine.edu	2021-08-19	3:00:00 PM	Robert Causey	Francis	Euthanasia scheduled for 3 PM today. Dennis Ruksznis to perform. Francis is noticeably more uncomfortable today and off feed altogether. Appears unsteady with heavy breathing. Posturing by pressing rump against wall 	At 7AM Temp 100.5, Pulse 68, Resp 20. Slow and unsteady on feet		Euthanasia necessary today. 	Euthanasia - Francis was walked to the compost windrow where he was sedated with detomidine, and euthanized with pentobarbital by Dennis Ruksznis. On post-mortem examination numerous small tumors found throughout mesentary, lung, liver, intestine, and along vertebral column. Large tumors found in pelvic canal originating from lumbosacral vertebrae. A large tumor (orange size) was found on the base of the heart where the aorta exits, and may have impinged on the aorta wall. Samples of tumors from heart, lung, and prepuce were taken to VMDL and submitted for histopath. Each tumor was well circumscribed and did not appear to be locally metastatic.  Cut surface was somewhat hemorrhagic. Presumptive differential diagnoses include fibrosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma.
