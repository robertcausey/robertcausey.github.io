<b>This World</b>
<p style="font-size:20px">
<I>Mary Oliver<br>
(1935-2019)</I><br><br>
I would like to write a poem about the world that has in it <br>
nothing fancy. <br>
But it seems impossible. <br>
Whatever the subject, the morning sun <br>
glimmers it. <br>
The tulip feels the heat and flaps its petals open and becomes a star. <br>
The ants bore into the peony bud and there is a dark <br>
pinprick well of sweetness. <br>
As for the stones on the beach, forget it. <br>
Each one could be set in gold. <br>
So I tried with my eyes shut, but of course the birds <br>
were singing. <br>
And the aspen trees were shaking the sweetest music <br>
out of their leaves. <br>
And that was followed by, guess what, a momentous and <br>
beautiful silence <br>
as comes to all of us, in little earfuls, if we're not too <br>
hurried to hear it. <br>
As for spiders, how the dew hangs in their webs <br>
even if they say nothing, or seem to say nothing. <br>
So fancy is the world, who knows, maybe they sing. <br>
So fancy is the world, who knows, maybe the stars sing too, <br>
and the ants, and the peonies, and the warm stones, <br>
so happy to be where they are, on the beach, instead of being <br>
locked up in gold.
